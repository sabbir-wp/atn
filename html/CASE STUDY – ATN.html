I mean, every other automation company automation company out there needs babysitting. You still have to manage the partner that's going on. This one, there were several days where I would eleven o'clock Pacific.\n\nI look at it, go to bed, wake up, boom. Stuff happened. It literally made money while I slept. So, okay, that's different.\n\nI don't have to check up on it to make sure that it's doing something productive.\n\nI just have to watch it to make sure it's performing You and Julio, man.\n\nJust down to Earth. He listens. You know, he wasn't trying to get me to move and coerce me a direction. He didn't do nothing needed to the guy who signed me up.\n\nBut if I had to tell anybody anything about ATN, I'd say, the reason I would go with this company is because the people that's running it, that's behind it, are genuine. They're not selling you a dream. They give you the realness. And when he told me how you were who he all kept the real and told me how you're moving around and doing certain things, you're still working your ass off.\n\nThat's a fact. You're still working your ass off. You ain't chilling with the money? Absolutely.\n\nI I when I heard that, I said, see. I saw he ain't just in on the bahamas sitting on the beach. He said, hell no. Said, may still work and try to figure out some other ways to make this better?\n\nAnd I said, see, that's what I'm talking about. Yeah.\n\nThis one is hands off, and it's just when you're sleeping, you're not doing anything that kind of passive approach It's just been sustainable. Yeah. The greatest thing about the going with you and a lot of, you know, the the ventures that we've been in is it's consistent and I like that. It, you know, I don't have to lift a finger and it's doing it when it's, you know, it's doing great, doing good things for me.\n\nSo appreciate is these kinds of calls where you offer your court, and and you basically show your transparency. You know, shady companies don't do this. It's just true. You you don't ever get this kind of transparency and communication really with with the shady company. That has been so good to me to see these frequent communication, just to give me more peace of mind that that, you know, my money is in a good place. That's that's been huge for me.\n\nHassle free. First of all, and daydreaming, you have to sit there see the charts and this and that, then you have to do, like, buy now sell now. This that this everything is automated. You just put in your money, you're good to go. You just set it, forget it. You can come back later once a week. Prosper the funds in your account to pound it over there.\n\nIt's it's the set and forget aspect of like this is truly you shut it up. Like you said, you let it go with with the networks. They they they do it. You set up the strategies and they do it.\n\nI I just gotta say that that sets this that sets this apart from other opportunities that I've seen anyway. I just know that I love this opportunity and I seek profits and I see where it's passive. But it starts with you, Erin, may I like I said, I could tell you were a family guy right off the bat, but not right there. Number one, that they really got me.\n\nThat's I I said, I know this is an honest opportunity with an on Skye to helm So but that did it for us. I love it.\n\nWell, just a tangible cash flow, passive income in such a short period of time has been obviously very beneficial as a bunch of articulated laid out, but I think opening my mind to the the possibility and the vehicles that exist and the methods that exist to back and develop large, large streams of passive income without the traditional hemes, right, from a clean, active, velocity to to get that much passive income had to be consistent.\n\nAnd then we're we're vetting them and making sure they're secure and safe and not gonna go away, you know, the next day, then having all of that is really, really a great thing, and it'll do a whole lot of different things.\n\nSo What what do you feel like actually makes ATN different?\n\nThe personal ability, the one zero one, that's that's what really got me because if you had to go tell folks that one zero one would be able to just pull it out. But the one zero one that he walked me through, and he's very personable. I loved it. I loved that about eighteen years.\n\nEspecially, you know, with the customer or I sent a email, customer support, answered all my questions, and then you were gracious enough to answer my questions, you know, over text or phone, resume know, I'm I'm I'm definitely pleased with the, customer support. The my issue I had with a lot of these companies, you you you can invest a lot of money. Best, you'll get an email We can't even talk to a live person. And so when I had something similar with crypto, I was so confused.\n\nI got stuck where I couldn't even invest. Because I didn't know how to navigate the app for crypto. I couldn't even talk to anyone on the phone. Yeah.\n\nAnd so here, I have someone that walked me through, you know, you would get the screen sharing and you were able to walk me through the the process to make sure, you know, everything went smooth and that I was making money.\n\nIt's those little things.\n\nIt's those little things, really.\n\nYou know? It's those little things. I mean, I I I've tried a couple of things like I said before. This is my first time talking to the owner of the company that I've been trying things with.\n\nThe fact that you guys seem to be more down the earth, not high pressure salesman, and I feel like I'm talking to a friend more so than talking to a salesman.\n\nI love everybody. I mean, you guys have been amazing, and I think that the warmth and automatically feeling like I'm a part of something. I'm a big it's a big family and, the genuine nature of just how you work, and that's what I look for. I look for, kind of that loyalty and that realistic view of things and how, like, the business will be, you know, and understanding it and explaining it to me. And It was just easy. It made it very easy.\n\nI I think I was sold on the group and the the, you know, the private group and just seeing more sold on just the idea of what you guys are doing and in a different aspect of something I've never really heard of.\n\nAnd trying something new. And that was a big part of it is, you know, and I think automatically being comfortable with the group and really explaining to me everything answering all of my questions.\n\nAnd I know I have a lot of questions, but answering all of my questions and and not being hesitant to to respond and and giving me all the nuts and bolts and not keeping me in the dark.\n\nYou've explored many different things, and I've explored many different avenues, of investing and and income and, you know, where where to put the money in with the best the best return for what we have I, you know, it's it's been the best that I have come across thus far.\n\nYour company or the business y'all running, you're running. It seems like for me, what hit home was how close I am. But I don't feel like me being able to talk to the CEO or the COO or the CFO still being at arms reach. That's like, I feel like I got in at the right time because I do believe that y'all gonna take off.\n\nAnd sooner than later, I might not be able to get to y'all. The way I want to or you might just be that big. You're gonna get you're gonna get that big. That's gonna be hard to reach.\n\nBut I feel like right now y'all are so tight It just it just works for me to be able to go on my phone and be able to text or to call and get a response within minutes. Hands down. That's it. Yeah.\n\nI I feel very secure that, your support and, the concept and also your programs, man. It's really great. Great. Because, basically, you don't have to do anything. Just, need to understand how you gotta move the money between the, the investment account, the process helping us, helping me go along and be patient.\n\nYeah. Which is very appreciated.\n\nI was reassuring that, you know, this was something that was gonna work because, you know, with most of these passive income opportunities, it's six months to a year before you see any profit, and this was one week, right, literally one week.\n\nI think I signed up on a Friday and the following Friday. I got my first profit.\n\nSo if that was pretty cool is having a coach and a little, really, a wealth management leader, like yourself, I'm kind of guy half leading the path and saying, hey, this is what I've done.\n\nThis is where I and and and you're right there, you know, when when I ask a question and and I say, hey, you know, what are your thoughts about? The staking. And what do you think about this? And and you're right there going, well, you know, don't don't do this. I wouldn't suggest it for, hey, do this instead.\n\nThose kind of things have really, you know, opened the doors to, you know, a further passive income and a lot less stress. And I think just opening the eyes and being just prized with the the return. Right? At first, it's too good to be true. Like, no way, you know, it's a it's a a face turner. It really is. And and just can't wait for more can't wait till more products come out and, and, you know, invest more and, just continue earning that that passive income and and creating that generation alone.\n\nWe'll use the best, especially in my case, you know, when I'm just starting, you know, I'm having some some some trouble and some difficulties of setting up my accounts.\n\nBut for the user, is there, like, every every hour I had to text him and he respond he respond right away. Who is the best? Yeah. He he helps a lot, but the program really works and the the support is good.\n\nFor me, it was, seeing some of the examples of the results. I know you showed me kind of some of your own personal results that you've seen from there. So that was huge. But, no, overall, it's been you guys have delivered on what you've, what you've said?\n\nI would say that the thing that makes you guys different is that you guys are reachable. I wanna say tangible, but if, like, there's a concern or if I'm apprehensive or maybe there's some slight anxiety about something. I can always just ask the question because, you know, clothes mouth don't get fed. So Yep.\n\nAsks, hey, what's going on with this? And what are we doing here? And and there's always like, hey, this is what's happening. Hey, we're doing this now.\n\nAnd that accretes, a sense of confidence and reassurance that. Okay. I did you the right people.\n\nUnderstanding that you have gone through the highs and lows made me comfortable in wanting to do business with you.\n\nA hundred percent.\n\nIt's definitely customer service. You know, I mean, being able to speak to you personally like we are right now and Julio just having him text away is different than any service. So even any financial service really. So that that's definitely made the difference.\n\nTransparency, there when when it comes to this, it's not the glitz, the glam, it's not the, hey, you do this. You'll be, you know, shopping on Rodeo Drive in twelve months. It's it's kinda like what's your ad dar, winning the lottery. This is to get to be true. You can sit here put whatever amount of money in and actually have the type of passive income that most people never get to have.\n\nThe response time, the communication, the honest tea and the verbiage and no beating around the bush. Ask a question you get asked.\n\nIndependent verification of your information.\n\nThat's terribly important because I don't know what's true on the internet. Anybody can put up testimonials, anybody can put up numbers on a screen. They're just screenshots. Who who knows where it came Right?\n\nBut independent verification through it was really comforting for me.\n\nThe communication on earth, I believe, was the first and, with you, you're always on point. Then, your other clients that you had on in your commercials to see their results, their truths of what they have done and see a result of now. Kind of pushes me. It pushed me, I should say then, to know, well, this this is something here real for the times that we are now that that can work And we can we can we can I can see results will come from this?\n\nI would say it's it's as passive as it as it gets. I'm aside from logging in each day. There's really no effort. The the main effort is really just the initial setup, which takes like ten minutes, and aside from just waiting for transactions to settle. You're just kind of rolling in each day. But aside from that, I don't know that I've come across anything this passive","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://atn.linkbuilderpros.com/case-study/?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script>

Aaron Richard's here. We are back and still here with my mom. This is part two.\n\nSo on this one, we're gonna actually go into more details of passive income specifically, how it's impacted our lives and why exactly it's important to make sure that you are focused on passive income and not just pushing it off and feeling like, oh, you know, I'm gonna be able to just save my way to retirement, and it's all gonna be great. So one of the things that we talked about in the, previous conversation that we did have was about, how I grew up and why I am who I am today. My mom was a big influence on that and also the family dynamic that we had But we'll talk about how her life has been impacted by my dad's illness and exactly how that's affected myself, but also our finances and then what specifically she's doing now and how that's helping her circumstances today through the use of ATN and and the help there.\n\nSo you might hear a voice in the background. You will hear a voice in the background. And it's from Joseph, who is somebody that you guys have probably no doubt have been seen before. But he's gonna be asking some of the questions to us.\n\nAnd we flew him out down here that's what I do for my team. It's really important to make sure that everybody experiences what it is that we have going on down here in Medogene. So without further ado, let's go ahead and get this started.\n\nWhat was your idea of retirement. And what was your actual plan towards that?\n\nSo I've, grew up kinda traditional, as I said, in the video, I started off being an engineer, I saved. I had a beautiful four zero one, k account, then kind of, like, ten years later, I went to work at a college. We have special state teachers retirement, that matched the portion of our income. And then at the time, my husband was working and had retirement and everything.\n\nSo we were very disciplined people, live within our means, just went to work and was just looking for that retirement. And then, unfortunately, my husband was diagnosed with a chronic illness of, Parkinson's disease. Had to retire early. I always thought that I was gonna retire at age fifty five coming up on age sixty two in a week or so and still having to work because, I had active income, five streams of active income, but as my husband's illness progressed, I had to stop working some of those streams.\n\nSo if I would have had an opportunity to invest and be part of something like ATN, I would probably be retired by now, even though I'm getting closer than what I was before, and I'll talk to you about that what my son has offered to me and his dad.\n\nAnd can you share with us the early days of when it started to happen and once you started to realize, oh, I need to start looking for alternative investments, or maybe I need to work some more hours.\n\nLike So in my forties, when we were raising the children, kind of in the forties, they were going off to college.\n\nSo we had three that were pretty close in same age just a few years apart. And so I would work I would do extra working as a adjunct instructor for the college that I worked for. I am an author. So I have written a book and I would do public speaking and then also, selling the book that I've self published.\n\nAnd there's doing some other consulting types of work, but as I stated, and those were really good income streams. But as the illness of my husband progressed, then I had to I couldn't go travel as much. To speak. I couldn't, teach the extra classes because he needed my time or attention or I needed to be coordinating efforts between his nurses and doctor's appointments and things like that.\n\nDid you have any in cleaning in clinics that this could ever happen?\n\nNever thought it. My husband was slim. Was very fit, was on, no medication and then went to from, like, zero to, like, fifty pills a day. We never thought that this would ever have happened to us.\n\nAnd then when it start happening, did you have to tap into your like, savings and retirements.\n\nWe didn't have to tap into the savings and retirement in the beginning, because as I, stated in the other video, that he was offered a wonderful severance packet. So we didn't have to tap into to savings at that time, but what we did have to tap into was alternative, lifestyles in a different country, for medical care that was way more affordable than what it costs to be in the United States.\n\nWhat was the cost in the US?\n\nSo in the US, even for today, right now, his medical care will be eighteen thousand dollars a month, eighteen thousand in the US for what he's getting here in Columbia. Right now, we are currently paying six thousand dollars a month, and we're actually getting lower care. So he has a twenty four hour care And then he has, a cook. He's in a private home. He gets a little bit more care for a third of the cost.\n\nAnd did you know about these expenses?\n\nAbsolutely. Right. We we're a family that talks about money, you know, pretty openly. And I knew how much it was. I was like, that's ridiculous.\n\nSo Did you also have to sacrifice time with your five income streams when the illness, like, started to having the early days.\n\nLike, they Absolutely.\n\nI had to begin to shut down stream one, stream two, stream three, because I just didn't have the time or the energy to do it. And then I travel So we've been here eight years, but every two months, I travel here to be with my husband for a week to two weeks at a time.\n\nSo before discovering AT and A, Right? You were in a difficult situation. What was life back then for you guys, right, before ATN? And how do you think things would be differently if ATN had been available? Ten years ago.\n\nWell, so when my husband received the severance package, if ATN would have been available, I would immediately invest it huge portion of the funds into ATM.\n\nWell, so that type of opportunity was not available. It's not available. To the public like that. Right?\n\nSo we have the opportunity to again offer this, but and it's just because of the relationships that I've been able to create fortunately of being in the right opportunities, the right place, and being persistent. But, ultimately, what happened was, who prioritized making sure that you had the cash liquid and wanted to make sure that you were able to pay for his expenses and have no real need for, like, for having to fill out paperwork in order to use the money or have check with a money manager in order to get the money out or whatever it was. So you prioritize that when in hindsight, we would have definitely better than better served to have assets and have cash flowing assets more importantly.\n\nBut, of course, you know, at that time, you did exactly what you felt was right and you I don't feel like you too much regrets.\n\nI don't have any regrets. Not not not not any.\n\nWhat was the emotional to a hundred person like?\n\nSo what has happened since it's a chronic illness and been for twenty years.\n\nWhat has happened is that my health began to deteriorate because of the stress because of the, man of his health care because of even the travel coming back and forth to Columbia every two months. Now some people might say you're fortunate to be able to travel like that, but It's people that's in America right now that's just the day to day of taking care of someone from being that caregiver. It is extremely, stressful.\n\nI, myself, personally, I was diagnosed with cancer two years ago and was able to get the proper health care here in this country in thirty days was able to get it How long was it gonna take in the US?\n\nOh my god. Six months to even get in to see I I called to get a second opinion on this, and they were, like, six months. And I'm telling you in thirty days, they had removed the cancer and had me scheduled for the radiation.\n\nMy son's paid for the radiation, and it's just having that passive income and being able to, set priorities and redirect things. Who would have ever thought that I would have been sick like that? But, we were able to respond to it in cash, unless we pay for even the cancer removal in cash, And then, my insurance reimbursed me, but we weren't playing with it. We needed the cash, pay for it in cash, and then I went to Aaron and his brother, to pay for the radiation treatment. And they pay cash for it. It's I mean, I've been cancer free now for two years.\n\nBut this is something that we also do wanna talk about. Right? Cause there's this idea of the perfect retirement, twenty years Roth IRA, four zero one k, sixty. No. When I'm in the sixty, I'm able to pull it out. With no penalties, things of that nature.\n\nHowever, based on your life experience, do you think it's a smart idea to just follow that traditional Absolutely not.\n\nAnd that was since the five active income streams, you never want to have all the eggs in the one bath it. You want to be able to have multiple streams. And the more that you can have the type of string where that you don't have to be active, then that is going to be more beneficial to you can then concentrate on things that are more important to yourself. To your lifestyle or to your health, doing things that you wanna do. It could be reading. It could be walking. It could be just relaxing.\n\nBut what did the Social Security Oh my god.\n\nWhat did they tell you? Trigger? What did they tell you?\n\nSo I worked ten years in corporate America.\n\nAnd I was guaranteed that you're gonna get x amount of money when you turn, retirement age. So and this is coming to me all in my twenties, all in my thirties, all in my florities. And then, bam, they start slowing it down a little bit. So I go into social security office probably, like, three years ago.\n\nAnd I say, hey, I'm thinking about retiring in the next three to five years. Just wanna know where I'm gonna be, how I'm gonna be sitting because you used to say I was gonna get this amount. And they said, ma'am, Tell me how much you make right now. And I tell them, and they say, you're going to get fifty percent.\n\nAnd I was like, but I already paid ten years into the program. This is you're gonna get fifty percent. So I went even for some reason, I'm a glutton for punishment. But I went even six months ago.\n\nAnd I said, hey, I'm gonna retire next year. How much are you gonna give me? They said how much is pension gonna be? I told them they said, not gonna get a nickel.\n\nNot zero.\n\nNot a From a hundred percent to fifty percent.\n\nFifty percent. Fifty percent. I don't really it's, like, whatever.\n\nBut then you're So my husband is living off a pension off of Social Security right now.\n\nI think that's a decent, Social Security check. I said, so as a surviving spouse when he transitions, what are you going to give me? Hey, sad.\n\nI was like, y'all, no. This is criminal.\n\nIt is criminal what you're doing. I'm gonna call fifty people out now and let them know that this is what you guys are doing. So he's getting a check right now. We use it for his health care, his expenses, but the day he dies, it cuts off and you better not cash that check if you get one because they'll try to put you in jail.\n\nIt is whack. We're not talking about the Social Security administration. A lot. If you think you're gonna retire and get a good Social Security check.\n\nThat is questionable. You need to go in and talk to them now because they are reducing it every two dollars that you make, every one dollar you make, they take two dollars away from you. So I was getting a very nice four digit check that I was supposed to be guaranteed when I retire, and it is it went from four digits to three digits down to zero. Zero.\n\nSo this is why I was so adamant about four zero one k's. I was like, so me, like, you guys can see, like, a a lot of this stuff that I'm doing now has to do with, like, what I've seen. Like, I prayed for wisdom when I was younger. Right? Because knowledge comes from, study, right, knowledge comes from, like, experiences, but wisdom comes from, like, other people's experiences and learning from those. And then also applied knowledge, right, applying what you learn. So for me to see her social security experience and me kind of going through the four zero one k, I was like, first of all, in thirty, forty years while I'm supposed to retire, they could create a policy and be like, yeah, you know, because we're going to war, or because we're doing this, we're gonna actually revalidate those funds.\n\nAaron, that's a great point. You have to watch. Because every couple years, they change the policy on you, the Congress, the legislation, they change the policy. So you can start off one way But if you're not on top of it, you'll be like me. Get zero.\n\nThe goalpost constantly moves. And that's one of the things that I was keenly aware of, like, when I was still in the corporate world, I was just like, look, like, if they're gonna play this game, then I gotta play the wealth game because I know that there people outside of this rat race. There's people outside of the four zero one k dependency, social security dependency. Like imagine all Like, think of the wealthiest person that right? And think about how often they will talk to you about their Social Security check. Think about how often they talk to you about depending on government assistance.\n\nRight? Really traditionally the wealthiest people that I know are anti government assistance or anti government involvement because they're just like don't try to mess with my money. I just made this money or I like it. So that's what I've always known.\n\nWhen I hear certain people talk about the reliance on their four zero one k or they're just that's their only option. Right? So you're not gonna you don't wanna leave free money on the table. So if you're in a corporate job, of course, if they have a match, hundred percent.\n\nYes.\n\nGet that match. Pre tax dollars or whatever. Like, get the match. But don't well, this is just my opinion.\n\nI wouldn't contribute past the match. And you should not. And you pay and you pay attention to what's happening with the four zero one. K?\n\nIs it performing? Okay. Is it performing to a standard that you're comfortable with? If it's not, is there a better is there a way to reevaluate that capital?\n\nRight? Let's say you have a hundred thousand dollars in that four zero one k account, but you've got a fifty thousand dollar student loan you got a thirty thousand dollar car payment, and you got twenty thousand dollars worth of, I don't know, personal consumer debt that you're just like, ah, like, I really need to get rid of this. Right? You could consider taking a percentage of that out in order to pay for that education, right, to pay for that past education.\n\nLike, that's what I did. I took out my four zero one k, I've got, like, probably in the four figures or whatever left in my four zero one k because I use a good amount of it to be able to make sure that, like, as I'm paying off things, I'm able to do it, like, faster. Right?\n\nAnd you have more available cash to you.\n\nExactly. So it only took me a couple of years to get myself out of consumer debt. Because I led what I knew that I couldn't really rely on thirty, forty years from from then. And then I also knew that I wasn't gonna continue on the corporate path.\n\nSo I was like, well, this little, like, fifty thousand dollar l four zero one k, and thirty forty years is gonna be a few hundred thousand dollars, but, like, I knew that, like, equity would take care of that. I knew that my business revenue would take care of that. I knew that income would eventually be able to take care of that. So that's what made me make that adjustment.\n\nIs it wise for someone to continue the traditional path or actually start entertaining other investment vehicles.\n\nIt's definitely wise for the person to entertain other vehicles. You just wanna do that period. Keep your traditional path. That's the point. And then you want to add. That's the point. You want to add and you want to be to make it as automated as possible so that you could be doing other things, especially enjoying your life.\n\nIt's not a it's not an either or.\n\nIt's it's a both hand.\n\nRight? Yes. It's definitely something that, like, for me in my position, I'm never gonna put myself in business. Like, don't do that.\n\nNever do that. That's not what you should ever do. Well, did you consider? And this is my counseling background.\n\nWell, did you consider this opportunity as well? Or did you, like, what about this for you in addition to that? Or well, tell me, like, in your eyes, How is that benefiting you right now and what will kind of happen in the future? Just kind of giving a chance to, like, really have them really think about where they're at.\n\nIf you're in a position where you're solely reliant and you only have that for retirement, then you would probably do well to consider the other opportunities that are out there to of course, diversify.\n\nSo, of course, also have increase, right, because one plus one is two. Right? But if you only have just the one thing, now you're just reliant. You're solely reliant. You're almost desperate, right, for that to continue to be successful.\n\nAnd, Erin, one thing that we've been doing as a family So when I actually do retire, I'm going to have more income than when I was working.\n\nYes. It's all documented. I'll I'll have more income than when I was working, but the problem that our family had is what about dad. So that's where ATN has come in to help to bring that me working every day, forty hours a week right now, when I actually retire, I will have more money, not working.\n\nWell, let's talk about that. Right? Cause there's a big reason why you are still working Right? And it's because you're not working forty hours a week.\n\nWell, hi. Let's call it guys call it later. I am a tenured faculty member of a college. And I'm not required to work forty hours a week.\n\nRight. So you're paid off of four. You're salaried off of a forty hour work week. But to be honest, right, is it anywhere between ten and twenty hours a week traditionally?\n\nIs it okay.\n\nSo for okay.\n\nYou know what? So let's just say, right?\n\nSo for me, I'm saying, well, I don't really, like, I recorded or not.\n\nRight? GC shout out lopes up. Maybe, you know, I, you know, during the pandemic, especially, during a pandemic especially house working ten or fifteen hours a week, but, of course, you still have to perform. You still have to earn your paycheck based off of the metrics that you're supposed to hit.\n\nBut I was able to work less and still earn the same amount. And that was a big reason why I was like, man, I've gotta figure out another stream. I've gotta have more streams because I'm not working forty plus hours a week. So for you, that's the only reason why you're still working.\n\nIf you were actually working forty hours a week slaving that at your desk like a a horse getting whipped, Right? Then would you be retired right now, especially based off of what I told you a couple years ago? Would you still be working?\n\nRight. I'll be glad Our Chapman can have to work one day a week.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo let's be real.\n\nRight?\n\nLike, we're here to be real about the reality of what's happening here. You've been here for about six weeks.\n\nI ain't seen you take no call. Listen. Alright. Hey. Listen. Right.\n\nIt's You're spilling the tea. What are you feeling the tea?\n\nWe're just here to be real. Right? Everybody appreciates authenticity.\n\nThis is gonna get the forty million y'all. Forty million likes.\n\nAt the end of the day.\n\nRight. You know, we we want people to just understand. It's not a oh, ATN is gonna be a lifesaver and a life changer, and it's we're gonna be able to, like, ride on like a a white cape and make sure to save the day. No. But what it is going to be an opportunity for you to be able to diversify for you to be able to have multiple streams And I ideally, a passive income stream like we provide to where you can set that aside or be able to, like, kind of have that be in the background while you're still doing the things that you need to do on a daily basis to make sure that your immediate needs are taken care of. And then you're essentially, leveraging the fact that it's passive to be able to just be earning and boosting your retirement, boosting your, your current savings in order for you to be able to do the things that you really wanna do and live life on your own terms.\n\nAbsolutely. That's what passive income is all about.\n\nYep. And I tell her all the time, right, in terms of, like, because she kind of is, like, in between myself as far as being a pretty aggressive investor, so to speak, or somebody who is a bit of taker. Right? Somebody who's who's okay.\n\nMy risk tolerance is higher than hers. Right? And that has to do with age, that has to do with my, just, my circumstances, right, earlier in my career. Right?\n\nAnd I can take some swings that maybe a sixty plus year old is not willing or able to take. But one of the things that I, like, strive for, and I always, like, wanna make sure that she knows for herself is it's like, we don't just wanna have, like, an okay or even a really good a really good life can have chilling doing good. Oh, everything's okay. Right?\n\nNot much to worry about financially, not worry much to worry about, you know, professionally. But I'm someone who strives for greatness. I'm someone who strives for excellence, being my best self at all times. Right?\n\nThat means, like, why don't you have enough money in order to be able to go on a yacht in the south of France. Right? Why don't you have enough money in order to be able to put a a nephew or a niece through college, not just your own it. Right?\n\nWhy not have enough capital to be able to really make an impact on villages in Africa or in your own community? Right? Some people are focused on their own retirement, which is great. But when you have a vision that's bigger than just yourself, that's bigger than just your immediate set of circumstances, then that's gonna pull you to a level.\n\nIt's gonna basically make you rise to a certain level. And and now for me being in a position that I'm in now to where I can support my family in that way. I told her a couple of years ago, I want to I'm intentional in wanting to be able to help. Not just the fact that it's hard enough living in Southern California with a full family, and of being only able to take care of myself in a suburban neighborhood.\n\nGreat. Wonderful. Well, but if I'm just able to do that, then what position is that leading you guys in?\n\nExactly. I'll have another section.\n\nThe thing I I think I wanna also talk about is the automated network portion. So what does that mean view area as far as the network portion.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo, I mean, your network, your community, you're only as strong as, like, the members of that community. Right? And that's why we're really specific and we really pay attention. I'm critical on who actually is a part of the network.\n\nIt's because if we just have people that don't really have strong minds. They're not really focused on or interested in their future and living their best lives. They're not really interested in, like, kind of being non traditional and having the having more than the average, those aren't the people that I really wanna be around so much because I strive for greatness. Right?\n\nIt it you're not you the one worst enemy of greatness is mediocrity. I don't want anybody in my network to be mediocre. I want them to at the very least strive to be their best self. The community aspect is just like each individual has a strong background, a strong level of expertise that could help the next person in the community.\n\nRight? We've got real estate professionals, Right? We've got people that are in, oh, business development. We've got people that are in mergers and acquisitions, and that, these real estate developers can connect with somebody who's in mergers and acquisition use some of that capital and create something amazing.\n\nRight? And we've seen these connections happen. So that's one of the things that I've been really a part of making sure that my executive team just as always aware of increasing the quality of clients that we have so that everybody has the opportunity to not only benefit from, but what we can help with on the in, which is passive income, but what can we also help it with in the back end, which is connecting people with other like minded individuals and people that are going to ultimately be able to really help them and get them to that level that they really wanna be at.\n\nDo you accept everything?\n\nOf course. Right. I mean, because a lot of people are mediocre for don't really strive to be passed than what's normal, what's traditional, and that's traditionally people are in the rat race. Right?\n\nTraditionally, people aren't earning passive income and not in a position to where they can retire early or retire on their own terms and they'll be able to to live life on their own terms. So now we don't accept everybody. So we have a a ton of calls every single week, every single month. And more often than not, they don't have the opportunity to, oh, get personally interviewed by me and figure out if it's a really good fit.\n\nOur advisors are trained and equipped to be able to know, okay, what specifically are we looking for? What quality of prospect are we actually looking for? Who's ideal? Right?\n\nWe pay very close attention to who is the ideal client prospect. And then, so the ones that get through the advisors and feels a good fit for them, then I'll come on. Have a conversation. Make sure that everything is aligned as far as expectations, as far as the goals that they have for themselves and what we can actually help them to provide.\n\nSo if it's not aligned, I'll kind of give my advice. It's really my but she mentioned in the other video that I'm living in my purpose, I'm kind of flowing in the work that I was called to do, which is to counsel and to be able to help people is to really understand and listen to where the person actually is. And if it's genuinely a good fit for them, that's what I'm gonna recommend. Right?\n\nI'm gonna give the stamp of approval. We're gonna move forward. But if it's genuinely not a good fit, right, you're pulling from your four zero one k, and that's the only source of capital that you have. I don't wanna have that happen for you.\n\nRight? I I don't want you to I I don't want it to be something that's an all or nothing. Right? I don't want you to be taking money off of your off of your mortgage or or risk risking your mortgage, risking your food, on the table for your family.\n\nThat's not how this is. Right? This is meant for people that are six figure earners or seven figure earners that have experience either automation burn realizing that they're trying to get passive income and they weren't somewhat, like, they weren't with the right team that could actually perform. These are for people that are in the stock market that are seeing the traditional seven to ten percent returns on a yearly basis.\n\nAnd it is for people that are in a real estate as well that are seeing that around ten percent annual return, and it's and it costs so much in order to acquire the properties, especially now. The interest rates are ridiculous. The housing market a bubble right now. It's not even a great time to get into real estate at this time, in my opinion.\n\nRight? So that's for that's, oh, who this community is for. And who this community is not for are those that are not like minded, don't wanna strive for greatness, don't wanna see what's next and see what's possible as far as earning passive income and being in a position to travel and live life on their own terms. So with that, you know, you know, as everybody understands how to be able to find us, you can click the link in the description to be able to know more about if ATN is the right opportunity for you.\n\nIf you're specifically looking for passive income, that can work in tandem with the other things that you have going on and really wanna strive to be, in an excellent position and live wherever you want in the world and travel however you want to. So with that being said, I appreciate you guys watching. Thanks, mom, for being a part of this. And maybe we'll do another one, but you may not see her again.\n\nSo Oh, she wants to be seen now. She gonna be seen now. Alright. So we'll see you on the next","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://atn.linkbuilderpros.com/case-study/?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script>

Okay. Because this is the only thing I got that's making any money because everything else was falling short.\n\nI would reckon number one from what the passive income Yeah. Definitely number one. I've only done a few truly passive income, but, yeah, those haven't panned out at all. So, yeah, it'll be up there for sure.\n\nNot even a question. This is the most transparent, the best one. The one that you really get I mean, you can really trust. I mean, I don't even think it's a question what the other ones are. We've all been through. I think everybody who gets to this point has been through all the things that we've all been through already. We all have this story.\n\nNo. No. No. I I don't have nothing. I don't have nothing else I'm doing right now besides what I'm bringing in. Yeah.\n\nThe fact that I'm even making money next or the following week says a lot about what y'all able to do.\n\nYeah. Right now, it's tops. Right?\n\nYeah. No. I definitely rank it towards the top. Because like I said, it's it's more of a true, passive model than the others. Even though, yes, they will run it for you and all those kinds of things, but there's still some work on the front end as well as, some potential work you have to kind of do throughout the the middle of it. So when you think about the term passive, I would say it's at the top of the truly passive list.\n\nOh, number one. Mean, I've only I'm not it's only been Amazon, Shopify, and ATN.\n\nATN. Absolutely.\n\nThe other two have lost money. So Yeah. Also, no brainer.\n\nNumber one, because your returns are much faster. It you know, the the the returns with, well, with with the the Facebook store and and with my Amazon store, they're they're quite small. I mean, it takes it just takes a long time to scale those stores so that you have a lot more income coming in. So So if I were if I were to rate everything that I'm doing right now, you guys would be number one without question.\n\nNumber one.\n\nNumber one, only because it's automated. It's like in your your doing I don't have to think about it. It just is fun. And like, doing anything, you know, not saying that I'm not asking questions, but I like the fact that I can just set it and forget it.\n\nSo I I would actually break it number one because it's literally the the easiest all I did was just press a couple buttons on my iPad I just invested the money from my bank account and, and now the money is working. So I I think it's actually, you know, really passive versus you know, other ones felt more like a job, but it's it's really money that's increasing while you sleep.\n\nATN, well, number one because this is my first time I'm doing a passive income opportunity and yes it is the best. I mean, I tried other like, again, I I tried other forms of, e commerce or, automation or other business strategies, and that took a lot of work for passive, you know, technically a passive automated self, you know, automated management approach. This is this is like a game changer or or it's it's like it's a no brainer. You you just sit around and it's paying at the end of the month. And, yeah, I'm excited as long as they have savings, why not? I mean, I mean, I don't wanna say why not, just go for it, you know, but definitely I I highly recommend it. It's it's number one.\n\nI would say I would rank you pretty high.\n\nOh, it's definitely number one for me right now.\n\nAnd If you look up the definition of ATN, it it does equal passive.\n\nSo One of the most transparent, you you you guys deliver what you guys there is no, well, I told you that this or I said this.\n\nIt it is one of those matters, Erin, that. You guys say this is what we can do for you, and this is what you deliver.\n\nHundred and ten percent. Because, I never really received any passive income from the others.\n\nBelieve it or not, I have this pretty much run on autopilot for you. It gives you huge sense of, like, security, not just financially but just mentally. It's running on autopilot. All you have to do checking.\n\nAnd if you feel like, hey, it's not growing enough, you can either, hey, is there a higher count? Is can I throw in more money? And pretty much I've asked those questions. You guys It's pretty much a little bit more of your control of how how, how much you want it to grow, how, and the speed of how you like it to grow.\n\nSo to me, that's awesome.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://atn.linkbuilderpros.com/case-study/?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script>

My name is Aaron Richards. I use these networks to make over twenty five thousand a month completely passively. It's how I was able to retire my wife so she could take care of our two kids.\n\nAnd pay for the sky high medical cost for my dad who suffers from Parkinson's. Getting to this point wasn't simple. I've gone through many failures. I've been scammed out of over a hundred thousand dollars by automation guru.\n\nBeen very close to giving up on my search for a passive income vehicle that actually works. I grew up in Cincinnati Ohio, which was a great time apart from the weather, of course. When I was twenty, I moved to Arizona to study for my bachelor's degree psychology where I met my beautiful wife brook. From a young age, my parents always instilled in me the importance of education, hard work, and financial literacy.\n\nBoth my mom and dad have doctorates and work professors, all while also being pillars of our community, only a church as pastors. If I worked hard in college and graduated suma Kunlati, working my whole way through college as customer service representative. After graduating, I started working as a guidance counselor, and at the same time completed my master's degree at Grand Canyon University. I continued to work as a counselor and eventually worked my way up to a figure a year position by the time I turned twenty five.\n\nThis is when me and Brooke got married and moved to Los Angeles. Two years later, her daughter was born. By twenty seven, I was what I call successful on paper. I was living the so called dream.\n\nMe and Brooke were both earning six figures a year. We had a beautiful daughter, and we're renting an apartment in a prime location, Santa Monica, Los Angeles, The reality, however, was very different. LA is expensive, so our salaries didn't go as far as we thought due to high costs and our student loan debts. Not only that.\n\nWe were both working long hours. Brooke was a full time nanny waking up at four thirty AM to work twelve hours a day, and I was trying to climb the corporate ladder. So while we were financially successful, We didn't feel success at all because all our time was going to our jobs, instead of the person that mattered the most at that time, our daughter Brighton. It was around this time I met Raul, a director at the company I worked at, burning well over six figures a year.\n\nI was fortunate to arrange a coffee with him, and we talked about anything in life that we'd regret it. Raul told me his biggest regret was not continuing to invest money. And because of that, he's still stuck in the rat race when he could have escaped if he was making more passive income. This one sentence changed the course of my life because all of a sudden, I knew what I had to do.\n\nI had to start taking investing seriously so I could make enough passive income to at least have Brooke not need to work. I had one problem, though. Had less than thirty thousand dollars in capital, not hundreds of thousands of dollars. So even if I got into something like stocks or real estate, it would take too long to make enough to retire Brook.\n\nI needed more money to be able to This was in twenty twenty when the pandemic happened. The world went into lockdown and suddenly I was allowed to work remotely. But because I no longer needed to travel in person to meet students, my hours went from fifty hours a week, down to ten hours. I now had an opportunity to figure out a way to make additional income and gather more investment capital so I could change my family's life.\n\nAt first, I looked at driving Uber, picking up scooters, quickly realized that wasn't a good trade off for my time. I continued searching and stumbled across an ad talking about becoming a remote salesperson for online businesses. This was right up my alley. I felt I could use my experience in counseling and customer service to learn the skill set quickly.\n\nSo I took the leap of faith and invested in a sales mentorship program. Fast forward a few months, and it turned out I was right. I started making ten k a month on top of my corporate salary. The online business I worked for was an Amazon automation company.\n\nAnd I guess due to the pandemic affecting stocks in real estate, Amazon automation was the big thing that investors were looking for. So I started to think I've been looking for something to invest in and make passive income. I now have the capital saved up, and I wanna put my money where my mouth is, don't wanna sell something. I'm not doing myself.\n\nSo I invested sixty thousand dollars into the same Amazon automation business. I was selling to other investors. At the time, I was excited. Was told because of the pandemic, e commerce was booming, and there was more demand for Amazon than ever.\n\nI thought this was gonna be the thing to help retire Brooke. So she could be a full time mom. The reality, however, was a lot different than I expected. It turned out to be the worst possible investment I could have made with my hard earned capital.\n\nIt took almost seven months for my store to be set which was twice as long as I was told. But worst of all, even after all the waiting, the results were honestly terrible. In my first month of sales on Amazon, I made a total of fourteen dollars and forty and profit. The next month, I made a hundred and twenty six dollars and sixty four cents on a sixty thousand dollar investment, which was nowhere near the returns I was promised.\n\nThe investment I thought was going to retire my wife was making returns that my local credit union can beat. As a husband and a father, I felt frustrated, but also ashamed. Looking back, I'm thankful I have a loving wife in Brook, But at the same time, her love and patience were completely tested. She told me she wasn't angry, and she was grateful for the work I put in to have our family in the financial position we were in by working two jobs but she said next time I needed to find something that I knew one hundred percent was going to work for the majority of people if not everyone.\n\nShe encouraged me and told me to take a step back and see it as a loss for us as a family, but also as a loss for the customers you sold on the same opportunity. This situation put me in a moral dilemma, and I thank my parents who were both passers for teaching me to be the type of person who practices what they preach. So even though my income would lower dramatically, especially because by this point, I had quit my core job. I knew ethically I could no longer continue to sell for that Amazon automation company so I left them.\n\nI was pretty off the idea of e commerce wanted to try something new. I've always been interested in real estate and came across the idea of Airbnb automation, which at the time seemed like a great opportunity because Airbnb was also experience working for the Amazon automation company allowed me to get a role as a sales director for an Airbnb automation company. And just like before, I did the same thing. I invested in the program I was selling, and I invested another forty five thousand dollars thinking lightning couldn't strike twice.\n\nWell, it did. Essentially, the same thing that happened with the Amazon company happened with the Airbnb company. It took forever to see my first payouts, and the payouts were nowhere near what I was told and to make it worse, my Airbnb account ended up getting banned shortly after, and I never got it back. At this point, I was at Rockball I had lost over a hundred thousand dollars to automation gurus, but on top of that, my son Ace had just been born, which meant further financial responsibility as a father.\n\nI realized that this automation world I was in was sleazy. A world where people don't care about their clients or their results. They just try to sell as much as they can of whatever they can to whoever they can. I quickly left the Airbnb automation company because not only did my results suck, But I was also seeing other clients have the same issues.\n\nI I wanted out of this world because it didn't align with my values, my parents taught me, or my background in customer service, which was always about putting the customer Instead, I was seeing people invest a lot of capital expecting a first class experience, but instead not being able to get through to anyone in support. At this point, I had pretty much given up on the idea of making of income and spending more time with my wife and kids. I was going to just go back to my corporate job and follow the traditional path of the rat race. But just like before, at my lowest point, Brook stepped in and encouraged me.\n\nWell, I'm sure most wives would have agreed with my idea to go back to corporate in a life of stability. She told me that if I did that, it would take away time from the kids. Told me she still believed in me, but I just needed to think smarter. I decided I was gonna give this whole passive income thing one last go.\n\nBut thanks to Brooke, I changed my strategy I always believed that my failures weren't because the idea that passive income was a scam. I knew there had to be something out there that worked. My mistake was I kept investing in the business model. I wasn't thinking about investing in the people.\n\nI realized it didn't matter how good the business model was if the people weren't genuine with real proof. So instead of throwing more money at automation scams, I invested in finding better people. I invested in my network through a twenty five thousand a year high level investor mastermind that I'm still a part of today. It's here where I discovered the idea of private trading network.\n\nMet a group of traders in the mastermind who were talking about how they're building out trading algorithms using their experience as traders coupled with machine learning. This caught my attention I've known that people can make a lot of money trading, but I always thought that you'd have to be at a computer all day looking at charts, which was not what I was looking for. The traders told me that used to be the case. But with the recent advancements in machine learning, they've been able to build algorithms that do the training for them, and they just oversee everything to make sure the algorithms are performing.\n\nI was blown away by the idea. So I asked them, more so begged them to let me invest. At first, they told me I wasn't the type of person they were looking for. They were looking for ultra high net worth individuals who have a net worth of at least five million dollars.\n\nNow I thought I was doing well for myself, but my net worth was nowhere near five million dollars, which meant I wasn't qualified to work with these traders, but something told me I just had to find a way to get I focused on building a genuine relationship with them, asking questions and sharing my story and why I was obsessed with making passive income and how I'd lost over a hundred thousand dollars so far trying to retire my wife. After a few months, Eventually, they let me join their network. Now because I had lost so much money already, I did start cautiously. I invested a thousand dollars and tracked how it would do for the first month.\n\nAnd just like they told made around what I expected. I invested more and more capital and eventually built up to a passive income of over twenty five thousand dollars a month, which is what I used to retire Brooke over a year ago. And while we're her was an incredible achievement and honestly the most gratifying achievement in my life so far. I was quickly reminded of what she told me when I lost all that money in the Amazon automation program.\n\nTake a step back. And see it as a loss for us as a family, but also as a loss for the customers you sold on the same opportunity. Oh my goodness. I finally found something that works.\n\nSomething that I'd be proud to promote, and I'm just gonna sit there and not try to help others. No way. My parents raised me better than that. And that's where the idea to start ATM came from.\n\nA community of like minded people who may passive income and grow together as people. It would only work if I could convince the traders to trade the capital of more people like me. In other words, trade for the top ten percent earners instead of only the top one percent. By this time, I had built a good relationship with them.\n\nAnd so after a bit of back and forth, I sold them on the idea of letting me license their service to people I resonated with, real, genuine people who work hard and just wanna do better in life for their family. As part of ATN, my vision was, yeah, about helping people make passive income, but it wasn't about just helping anyone. I wanted it to be an exclusive community of people I myself in, cool people that I could see myself having a drink with. It's why I'm very selective about who I let join and actively reject people who I don't feel like would add to the community","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://atn.linkbuilderpros.com/case-study/?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script>

What's going on, people, Aaron Richards, are here with my wonderful mom, Kim Richards, and I'm here because, we're in Metagene Columbia, and I was able to help my parents and afford to be able to be down here because of making twenty thousand dollars a month in passive income. But, of course, I didn't actually start there. I was, you know, burned by automation.\n\nI lost six figures ultimately. I'm trying to, you know, figure out how to earn passive income. A lot of my journey has all kind of led me to where I am now and how and why I created ATN. But of course, like, you know, a lot of people that I talk to, a lot of clients or prospective clients that I to, they actually ask, why don't you have a hundred thousand followers on social media or why aren't you acting like, oh, that you have Lamborghinis or renting out mansions and things like that?\n\nWell, ultimately for me, was raised. I don't wanna compare myself too much, but I was raised differently than that. Right? And that's not ultimately going to actually help me take care of my family or help in that regard.\n\nSo one of the reasons why I wanted to be able to come on here and and talk to to my mom and have a quick conversation was because I want people to understand where I came from and how I got things started why I have the mindset that I do to have multiple streams of income, but without further to talk about, let's go ahead and introduce Kim Richards.\n\nThanks, Aaron. I was born and raised in a town right outside of Cleveland, Ohio, continued my education to become an engineer and then work for an amazing company, General Electric, for ten years. I've been married for forty years to Aaron's dad, and kind of halfway in between those forty years, my husband, developed Parkinson's disease.\n\nAnd when that happened, we had to make some serious decisions he was working full time at in the pastorate and had to go into a forced retirement and the board of directors decided to give him a severance packet. We thought it was a pretty generous severance packet, but found out that due to the cost of health care in America, that money kinda dwindled really fast. So thank god. I had always been raised by my mom in a single parent household where you don't put all your eggs into one basket.\n\nSo I learned early on to have multiple income streams. But we had these multiple income streams, but we were faced with this health challenge. So we spent a lot of money, hundreds of thousands of dollars in the United States, and then to learn that you know what, and we would consider going outside of the United States and looking at some alternative health care systems that are superior to America that our funds could last longer. We that's how we had landed up in, Medellin, Columbia.\n\nWe've been here now for eight years. Through Erin kind of adapting early gone, a good understanding of personal finances, and a good understanding of passive income He has now afforded my husband and I the opportunity to be able to retire comfortably because of this opportunity that his company, provides.\n\nWell, I appreciate that type of credit, of course. But a big part of the reason why I was focused on finances and understanding that I was actually in a rat race was because you gave me some advice just before I got married. And, actually, it's crazy. So right here, like, eight years ago, I came down here by myself I was with Brooke at the time.\n\nLike, we were dating or whatever at the time. I came down here after I actually got let go of a corporate position. I was laid off but they gave me, severance package as well. Right?\n\nIf I came down here, I was chilling. I was like, oh, man, I got several thousands of dollars. I'm like, twenty four or twenty five years old. So I just wanted to set goals.\n\nI wanted to, like, really, like, make sure that I was intentional about all the money that I had and then also the next direction It was down here where I decided to become a counselor. It was down here where I decided to marry Brooke. And then I was down here where I asked my mom about what do you feel like of the things that I should be learning about or some of the things that I should study, what should I like to take, like, as a next challenge? And she was like, you need to learn more about personal finance.\n\nAnd I was like, well, and actually the specific way you said it was, you need to study money. I was like, money. What do you mean? Like, I already know how money works.\n\nYou get a couple dollars. Right? You spend, or you save a couple you spend a couple. Right?\n\nLike, whatever. So I was like, I already know how money works. I've been seeing money for my whole life at that point, twenty five years. But I went down a a a really long self study of money, and that is what ultimately developed me into being able to ultimately leave the rat race after making six figures, and then figure out how to be more of a entrepreneur, a self sufficient contributor to the market.\n\nSo, of course, that really helps with where we're at right now. Now with that being said, you know, how would you describe my journey from your perspective, after, like, I kind of went into the professional world?\n\nNo. I got a real set story to tell. Well, the reason why I come to focus on finances, because at that time, we had set up a trust fund for them. And I had met with them right that's right before we came over here.\n\nI met with them and I told them, gave them all three and I told them what they were gonna get, what they were gonna inherit. But as of July of this year of twenty three, my husband outlived all of his insurance. They had to forfeit it. Their inheritance is really cut in half.\n\nHe's outlived it. Outlived it. So policies that we were paying a hundred and fifty dollars a month for, we had to pay four thousand dollars a month for it. And we had a family meeting.\n\nIt was, like, let them go, mom, but that was that was their inheritance. So you need to have another stream.\n\nYou gotta have some other stuff going on in your life Kim, based on your experience, because Aaron shared from his side of you, he came here.\n\nHe was given under a lot of guidance. He's able to stand on your shoulders for advice. But what was it from your perspective as far as inborn eyes own money journey, but also you having to wear multiple hats during this time because that's not really being mentioned. You had five streams of income, but you're also a caretaker of your husband who sit. So can you elaborate a little bit more on that aspect?\n\nI think the the journey has been how can you continue to grow in life?\n\nContinue to meet life's challenges and continue to allow your children to be the best that they could possibly be under the shadow of taking care of someone with a chronic disease. So my husband now has had the Parkinson's for twenty years My primary goal was for Aaron and his siblings to be able to continue to grow and become their own person. So having that in mind, I've always had multiple income streams so I can kinda go to this bag or that bag. For their continuing education for their purchasing of their own homes. So always making sure that there was income available in the house.\n\nSo I think you kind of decided to have, like, a bucket of, like, a one stream of income was for this.\n\nOr Yes.\n\nDiversified.\n\nSo one stream was for the Children's Education.\n\nOne stream was for purchasing of real estate. Another stream was for vacations. Another stream was for purchasing automobiles. But just make sure that there was always a nice flow.\n\nBut like I stated, when the health care crisis came up, then these buckets kinda were shut down a little bit because I had to now divide my time to take care of my husband. So you have time and energy, and then also trying to take care of myself, making sure that I might say this. I don't know if I can say it on camera, but then I didn't gain five hundred pounds. And that I still had a good quality of life for myself as well.\n\nSo it's balancing and what, how this impacted Aaron. I always wanted him to be able to be his own offend itself and make sure that he was able to grow and to advance, emotionally, financially, spiritually, in all areas of his life.\n\nWhen it comes to Eric, what was some moments in his journey that Oh, he's really taking life seriously. He's actually really following my actual guidance of advice, and he's not just brushing it off and being a delinquent son.\n\nIt's just making the And, actually, I I I believe when Aaron went to Grand Canyon University, I think that really changed his life.\n\nSo, for example, he took a job where he was, working at at night, and then he would just was doing online classes before online classes was really popular. And that's how he got his, bachelor's degree. And then I did a challenge for him to continue on, to get his masters. I think this is important for ATN.\n\nI think people need to know your educated. Okay. You they don't believe that. Even though I'm an educator, they're like, it doesn't matter, mom, but yes, it does.\n\nSo He continued his education.\n\nAnd in continuing his education, he began to look for other ways, other income streams for himself.\n\nWith the higher education? Like, what made you do that?\n\nSo why I followed her advice with higher education is because I saw that she was making six figures. And then I saw that my sister who so my older sister, she's four years older than me. My brother is, like, a year and a half older than me. So I've seen them as far as, like, when they graduated college, like, they were able to eventually, like, find a good jobs that we're making, I don't know, like, just under six figures or whatever because, of course, you're not gonna necessarily start.\n\nYour professional career making that amount, so to speak. So I saw that. I was just like, alright. Well, I wanna be able to have a good baseline of income.\n\nBut that was one of the biggest reasons why I was like, alright. Let me buckle down and eventually get my bachelor's degree. I was really, like, challenging my self with education because I had a tuition benefit that said if you had an a, you would get a hundred percent tuition, paid for. If you had a b, you get ninety tuition.\n\nIf you gotta see, you get eighty percent tuition paid for. And I'm like, so then you're saying that I could get a hundred percent of myself paid for as long as I get paid, but that's why I graduated suma cum laude because I was absolutely motivated to actually get those grades. So not only for the education portion as far as like what it could do for my, like, professional career, but also I took it as a challenge. I'm a pretty competitive person.\n\nSo that was, like, one of the biggest things there.\n\nAnd that he so he's so he kinda got his momentum going academic And then when he took his job at the university, they said, well, if you hit this certain target performance wise, you could work from home. This is way from before remote work was even possible in America. So they would give him incentives. He was just killing He's just killing it.\n\nOh, I can work from home. One day, if I hit this goal right here. Oh, I can work from home two days if I hit this goal right here. So I think those things are very important in life.\n\nThe same way if you are a person that's trying to increase your financial base and invest with ATN, this is the type of mindset that you have to have. There has to be a goal. And then you just begin to climb and climb and climb and climb and climb and climb. And that's what Aaron has done.\n\nDid study did your whole sub study phases on finances because a kit. Right?\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd then tell us what you did differently with the day Ramsey's self education.\n\nWell, yeah. I mean, so like we're talking about being competitive. Okay. Like, alright. So I'm challenged to learn more about finances.\n\nI'm challenged to learn more, like, to to develop more in that regard. So I was like, alright. What can I do? How can I take this?\n\nLike, how can I take this and really excel with it? I just went to YouTube university. Right? So that's where everybody has to go and get started.\n\nStarted listening to Dave Ramsey. Right? So some people call him Steve Ramsey, but, you know, and, you know, for him and and she was, like, big into Susie orman and stuff like that, but they're they're both kind of almost cut from cloth in that regard. That's kinda where I got my start as far as understanding about finances, personal finances.\n\nAnd then I graduated to Robert ASaki and the rich dad poor dad and everything like that. It started off with just understanding that you needed to be able to control your debt or and control your expenses And then you really, like, at the same time, my mindset was being an offensive player. Right? I'm gonna focus on increasing my income as well.\n\nSo some people just focus on decreasing their expenses when I was focusing on increasing my expenses at the same time. Right? So creating that gap to where ultimately I was able to have enough money to pay for a paying down my debts, and that's when the story of me and Brooke in Venice in six hundred square foot apartment. So just grinding away during COVID and paying off all of our consumer debt because of our belief in following a date Ramsey, And then ultimately, we grabbed, like, we were at a point where now we have more income coming in than our, like, massively more income coming in than we actually needed to put out that allowed for us to save a good amount and then be able to have the opportunity to purchase our first home, which in Southern California, we were living in LA, and it's a million dollar market, right, first buying your first home.\n\nIt's a million dollars, right, in Los Angeles. So we decided to take advantage of the fact that we had we were remote, but we were able to somewhere. That was a little bit more affordable, but my mom was able to step in and challenge us as well. Right?\n\nYou when you issue me a challenge, then I'm gonna take it and I'll decide to overcome it So or take advantage of it. If she issued a challenge and said, we'll match whatever you're gonna contribute to your home as a down payment, which motivated me even more to have that capital to do it, which ultimately, that led to me, like, having my first real taste of, like, capital, like, a a solid amount of capital because now I had equity. Was when the housing prices were just before the boom that happened in, like, kind of twenty twenty, twenty twenty one. So she helped me get into a house that helped me get equity And then now all of a sudden I had the ability to take a HELOC and use capital in order to start to generate more.\n\nSo that was kind of like the lessons that I learned from some of the books that I was reading and some of the information that I was getting from these financial experts. So that was really helpful.\n\nAlways your side seeing him go from your young son to now becoming a young man.\n\nI think when I saw Aaron, like I said, when he took off academically. And then when I came down to visit him and Brooke and saw how he managed his job, I said, this dude is a beast. Oh my god. He's got skills.\n\nYeah. I guess that was like the old lady e's dropping or something like that, but it was like, he's got skills here and with all three of them, I've always been like Go. Go. Go.\n\nGo. Become your best self. Do what you wanna do. Do it with integrity.\n\nDo it with, authenticity, being yourself, and then the sky is the is the limit. You can do whatever you wanna do. And then So when I was watching him perform his job, then I would say, well, Aaron, you know, you probably could do this or you probably could try that. And then he would he'd kinda chill. Like, he's got a real chill kind of personality, and then he would just think about it. And even from a little boy, now the mama stories, But a little boy, all he had to do was look at something.\n\nAnd he was like a toddler and his siblings were older, but he just looked at it one time and jumped up and then he was walking He was riding a bike. He was doing this or that. He just looked at it just one time, did it real good, and then he was out.\n\nThe one thing I've noticed is that you've been supportive throughout his whole journey. You're not it doesn't seem like of the mothers that you can't do this and that you don't understand.\n\nNo. Not at not at not at all. We have three children, and they're all different. And I and I've always wanted him to be the leader.\n\nHe was a mischievous as a a young boy, but what I would tell the teachers is he's a leader. I need you to challenge him. Need you to motivate him. I need you to provide him something else.\n\nHe's bored. Give him something else to do. And then there's a truck around our house. So when they were young, kinda between seven to ten, learned early on, they couldn't say that they were bored.\n\nBecause if they said that they were bored, they had to close the phone up, they had some dishes to watch, they had a grass, So grass outside the cut. Early, they learned how to entertain themselves, how to motivate themselves, but he's carried that on.\n\nOh, you're bored. I'll give you something.\n\nYou did something to do. That's what you need to take.\n\nSo is that what led to transitioning to also the ATN success was challenged by one of my peers, right, in the, I went into digital consulting.\n\nI met, an individual who was, like, oh, he wanted me to come work for them at a company that he was a sales leader at we'll saw some something in me to be able to, like, come on and, like, eventually become a sales leader for that team. And I I got on the team, and I was just like, I'm not really interested in, like, just working commission. I wanna, like, I wanna have an ability to, like, okay, great. I I work.\n\nI I I make commission. I make sales or whatever it is, but then I also wanna have the streams of income coming in, or that are passive preferably that I'm using my capital to be able to, oh, grow. What I noticed was, after I kind of, like I said, that I didn't really want to take that role, he was like, oh, man, but we gotta figure out something. How are we gonna work together?\n\nHow are we gonna do this? And I was just like, well, I do have something that is working for me right now. And maybe I could kind of talk to my friends and talk to my family about it, get a proof of concept make sure that what actually works for multiple people, but if it works, then, hey, we can actually, I'll promote this and I'll actually start to provide this opportunity to other people. Right?\n\nThat was one of the things at that point. I was kinda challenged by him to figure out how we could actually work together, and then eventually it grew into, like, okay. Great. Like, it works for friend, it works for family.\n\nAnd then now we have something an an opportunity to be able to spread it to spread it to a lot more people.\n\nSo I wanna pick up on this. Was it part of your pastoral upbringing and counseling role. I had all the children tested when they were young. He tested in the area of to being a counselor.\n\nBeing that type of, a servant leader like that. He's flowing in his natural gifting. I remember when he called me to tell me about this peer wanting him to come over to this other side. And then he kinda let me know, mom, I think I'm gonna go out on my own.\n\nI'm gonna go out on my own. And then, kinda like within six months or a year of that conversation. So he told me he says my intentions are to help you with dads. Health care expenses.\n\nHe says it's gonna take me a year to two years to be able to do it, but I want to be able to help with that direct expense.\n\nAnd then he said in another conversation, you know, so you want to retire. How long is it, how long is it going to take? And I said maybe about two years or something like that. He says, no, what's the gap?\n\nWhat's gonna be the gap between, what you're making now and when you retire? So I gave him that gap number. He says, No problem. Mom retire when you wanna retire.\n\nI said What?\n\nI kept that in the back of my mind, kept chugging away, giving him time to build the business and to grow and to and to make adjustments. And then his family was growing as well, you know, things like that. And so, but now the day is here. I'm gonna be retiring this year and by the end of the year, He's he's positioned. He's he's set, and I'm grateful.\n\nSo I also wanna show you, like, ask from your perspective. Right? Because I know you talked a little bit about the social media thing, but I don't think people realize how important it is. To know what's the main thing.\n\nRight? You focus the main thing, which is taking care of your sons and also wearing multiple hats. Right? You kept it the main thing.\n\nRight? And then also for you, that's exactly how you're translating into business, but I wanna hear from your perspective. Right?\n\nYeah. So, I mean, originally, like, as a kid on millennial. Right? I'm gonna be on social media or whatever, and it's gonna be like, you know, high school, early college days.\n\nBut eventually, because I was still, you know, chasing a football dream and trying to figure stuff out. I didn't really, like, focus as much on school as I should have. I was kind of just, like, doing, like, kind of, like, part time school and, like, not really being serious. And so what that ended up being was me, like, I was kind of left behind a little bit.\n\nI was twenty one twenty two, and I'm seeing all of my friends graduate from college of how am I seeing that? I'm seeing it on social media. So I'm just like, Man, like, you know, the studies have shown, like, at, like, years after I I really was off the social media. It's like, hey, like, oh, that really affects your dopamine level like it could be, like, it could lead to depression if you don't get a certain amount of likes or this about or this or whatever.\n\nSo I was really, like, before I got to the point where I was like really feeling depressed or whatever, I just got off social media at, like, twenty two. So from my twenty two to, like, twenty like, thirty. Right? I really got back on social media in order to, like, really just started with LinkedIn.\n\nAnd then, of course, of starting this business, you kinda have to have some sort of social media presence. So for a whole pretty much decade, I was off social media. I didn't really care. I didn't really place too much value on it because when I started making six figures at what, like, twenty seven or whatever it was, like, should I get back on?\n\nShould I get an IG now? So should I flex now? Should I, you know, like, you know, get a nice watch and, you know, show that, or should I, like, get a nice souped up maxima and show that. Right?\n\nLike, what should now should I do that? But it was just like, no. Like, if I didn't care about it and then why would I care about it now? Right?\n\nThat's a big part of why I don't really care to be in front of the camera. I'm just like, look at this. I'm there. I look at that up there.\n\nOh, oh, look at this. Right? So that's not really how I wanna do things, or I don't wanna, like, go buy a Lamborghini, not to, like, flex or anything, but I could buy a Lamborghini in cash right but that's something that I'm not going to do because I understand the importance of building assets. So Lamborghini is not an asset.\n\nRight? That's a extremely lie extreme liability. I know people that have, like, Lamborghinis in these super cars. And they're like, oh, it's always in the shop, and, oh, it's always this or that.\n\nIt's like, you know what I mean? Like, those are first world problems, but not even, like, a really useful liability, even a bill it is. Right? So for me, I've always focused much more on the substance of something, rather than the artificial, superficial, or kind of flash of it all.\n\nSo that's a big reason why I'm not really big on social media like that. So really, ultimately, the majority of my time that I spend on a daily basis is with my clients and with my executive team figuring out the best way to perform, figuring out the best way to produce results for them, because ultimately for our business, that's the number one most important thing. Client's results in satisfaction.\n\nSo shout out to Julio from being a satisfaction king. Julio is our onboard specialist. He's the person that he's the success manager. Ultimately, so everybody's favorite person to be able to meet after me, of course, they'd meet him.\n\nAnd then they're able to just like, oh, man. Like, you're such a patient person. You're able to help me. So easily, if you're able to walk me through these things and you're so available, So it's a team effort and ultimately, again, just what I spend all of my time focused on when it comes to, like, specifically ATM related things.\n\nIs ultimately just client success.\n\nSo how do you think Aaron's success and what he's found with ATN is helping you prepare for your official retirement I I think what Aaron is doing by collectively bringing a group of talented people together and providing, client fulfillment at the highest level is what's critical here because there are lots of conversations that are going on social media and on YouTube just on all these different platforms, but who's really executing?\n\nWho's really producing?\n\nSo A lot of people aren't producing.\n\nThat's what I That's it.\n\nTrying to execute. Who?\n\nThat's that's fine. I mean, So some of us, like, being in the space a little bit more that most people don't realize about the industry. Right? Like, these people that have a million followers, like, it doesn't determine how much money you have in the bank or how much how many assets you have in your portfolio.\n\nLike, we know plenty of people that have a million followers that, you know, can barely make ends meet and they're living a well above their means. So for me, I wanted to not live well below my means, but definitely still prioritize the things that are actually important, which are actual assets and cash flowing assets to be specific. You know, focusing on cash flowing assets leads to being able to have more income than you need for your immediate circumstances. My immediate circumstances are my wife and my two kids.\n\nRight? But in order to be able to make the impact that I wanna be able to spread some of the the resources that I have to the ones that I love the most, of being able to help my mom in way. And then, of course, helping my dad as well on take some pressure off of them has been, like, it's an intrinsic thing. It's amazing.\n\nI I'm really thankful to be able to do it. But I I do feel like that's a part of, like, you know, me being a man and me being b man. She hurt you heard her say that I was a leader early on. Even though I'm a youngest, I definitely have always felt as though, like, it's on me.\n\nRight? So now that's what it is.\n\nAnd, Kim, this is a fun question for you. Okay. But what are you most proud of when it comes to hair?\n\nJust get it done. Like I said, from a little boy, saw it and just would just do it. Just get it done. The the the execution.\n\nYeah. So when it comes to parenting, because it seems like you did a great job, also to not allowing from my take on it doesn't seem like you allowed your emotional stress. Which your husband getting sick also affect the family because it's regardless of, like, a very emotionally turbulent time.\n\nI intentionally did not want them to experience any of that.\n\nI wanted them to be able to their debt, became ill when they were in high school. So I wanted them to be able to complete high school wanted them to be able to complete college.\n\nEven though the Aaron's brother asked me. He was a sophomore at Arizona State. Did you want me to come back home? Do you want me to help to stay home with you.\n\nI said, nope. I want you to go back to school and graduate from college. So I'm just, I guess a proud moment is I'm just glad that he's completed his education and has a beautiful family and now wants to reach back and say, Hey, thanks, mom. Hey, thanks, dad.\n\nI'm really that makes me very, very, very proud that he's a generous person and that he wants to help others. You know, he doesn't he doesn't wanna just be the the the head guy and then not help anybody the way he's taking care of you guys here on this trip, you know, the way he takes care of his siblings, He has a, a, a first cousin that he's helping out. Yeah. That makes me proud, willing to help others.\n\nThat's what the Richard is all about. Now we get ours, we're gonna help you get yours, and we're gonna help you keep yours. And that's why I wanted him to study money so that he didn't understand. It's not just about making money, but keeping money.\n\nAnd then it's about also blessing other people with your resources.\n\nSo a really well known order once said, what good is first class if my homies can't sit. So it's a big part of what I'm about.\n\nI think where's my little notebook on here? And that purple notebook over here talking about raising successful millennials. That's what I'm really You you you want to raise the kids where that they are successful in their own right, in their own areas but then they also have a passion to give back and to support others.\n\nOf course, you reach back into your immediate family You reach back for your parents, but then others. We are our best self when we're serving. When we're serving other people, that's when you're gonna experience fulfillment.\n\nTo know that, my son has achieved some level of success, and he's willing to help me to retire any moment that I want to retire is going to supplement to know that his dad has, outlived his insurance policies, outlived his, severance packet that he he's worked fifty years of his life, but now he's outliving all of it because of an an illness that he can no longer work, and he has a mind to want to help the family. This is what success is all about. It's just not about keeping money upon yourself, but we are our best when we're helping others.\n\nSo what advice do you have to those parents would just say aspirations?\n\nSo at age forty, I invested in personal finances. I was familiar with Dave Ramsey and Susie Orman. Those were the gurus at during my time, What I'd like to say to every young parent in raising successful children is teaching them the core values of I'm gonna get I might get church here with you guys, but loving your neighbor as yourself, but love yourself.\n\nHelp yourself, but help others, and then continuing to set goals and challenge yourself. Okay. You've accomplished this. Okay.\n\nNow, step it up. Step it up. Step it up. And then while you're stepping up and while you're growing, lift up other people, teach the children how to give back.\n\nTeach the children how to go into neighborhoods that don't look like their neighborhoods and help help people, teach the children with money management with allowances and with chores with other opportunities. But the main thing is the giving back portion.\n\nHelping someone that's not gonna ever be able to help you helping those and doing it on a regular basis.\n\nHow does it sound like, like, the fear or, I guess, pressure consuming you at all.\n\nI never thought about it like that. It never dawned on me at all. That's why now we're having a family meeting and everything. We didn't know we were gonna be here for eight years, but we knew that economically it was going to allow our money stretch and to go further.\n\nWe knew that their health care system was good. We just we're people of faith, just taking steps of faith, leaps of faith. And believing and trusting in god that it's all gonna work out. It's all it's all it's all gonna be good.\n\nFor fear, some people call it false evidence of things appearing to be real, but I'm not concerned with fear at all. Not not at all. And it's about the goal setting. It's about, hey, what do we wanna do?\n\nAnd then Erin, like I said, he's like, let's go, mom. Let's go. And that's just kinda how we kinda I raised them and they grew up, and they were exposed to some really good, environments.\n\nSo So for me, with fear, I take it as a challenge.\n\nYeah. Because it's more of, like, alright, when you're faced with adversity, like, how do you respond? Right? You could either run the other way.\n\nYou could try to go around it or you could go through it. Like, and that's I choose mostly to go through it. Right? If it makes if it's not an opportunity to go around it while, like, allowing for me to really get past it and not just like, alright.\n\nNow it's just sitting on my side. Right? I I still have to live with it and and everything like that. So I would rather go through it if that's what it's meant to be.\n\nI I'm never gonna run from it. So that how that was instilled was because I saw her, you know, face adversity all through her life and my dad face adversity, especially, when he was, what, a diagnosed twenty plus years ago. So that was one of the things that I saw from them. And for me, I knew that I wasn't going to just succumbed to something that I feel like was just a challenge and opportunity for me to get better.\n\nRight? You get better through a struggle. You get better through adversity. So that's what I felt.\n\nBecause the reason why I mentioned fear is because you could've been fearful when you guys went into an automation package together, and it didn't work out.\n\nHundred percent. She was one of the the reasons why I was trying to get passive income as well, because again, I was wanting to be able to help them, right, and helped myself as well, but I wanted her to have the opportunity to see real passive income. She had multiple income streams, but they were all active sources of income. And so when I went to her and was like, hey, like, I think I there's an opportunity here that we can, but really make some passive income, I think that this could work She was supportive and she was like, I think that, well, let's go ahead and try it.\n\nLet's see if this works out. And, of course, that one did not work out, but She never blamed me. She never was, like, angry with me or, like, oh my gosh, we lost. Like, she has an investor's mentality as well.\n\nAnd just in the way of, like, hey, we tried something. That didn't work, but just basically just keep going. Keep trying to figure things out. She she's always been like, alright, like, what, like, That happened.\n\nWhat's next? How do you respond? What's the what's the next move? Right? What's not? Oh, getting knocked down and staying down, and she's gonna coddle me and give me a blanket and, like, oh, read me a story on the ground.\n\nRight? She's like, alright. So that happened. Alright. Like, and, you know, let's go ahead and get up.\n\nLet's start to walk again, and that's always been a a part of, you know, how I've grown up. And now that's what I'm instilling with my kids. So when talking about, like, passive income and, like, how we failed in the automation space at first, we still needed to actually find passive income So on the next video, we'll go ahead and dive a little bit deeper on exactly how we were able to get past the failed automation experiences and end up on the other side of it. To where now we're able to, you know, pay a a pretty, high amount as far as expenses, but also live very comfortably in, you know, the cities that we want to live in.\n\nSo you can check that out over here.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://atn.linkbuilderpros.com/case-study/?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script>

Like, what what is, maybe some things that you would say to them?\n\nMay, it's where you start. If you wait till tomorrow, you may not start. You need to start today.\n\nSo if I had to tell anybody anything about ATN, I'd say the reason I would go with this company is because the people that's running it, that's behind it, are genuine.\n\nThey're not selling you a drink. They're giving you the realness. Who here kept it real and told me how you're moving around and doing certain things. He said, man, he's still working trying to figure out some other ways to make this better. I said, see, that's what I'm talking about.\n\nWell, I I would be very honest and say that that that in general, I've spent a lot of money on other things that that I've either lost or hasn't produced. And and and I've kind of told this to my sister-in-law. I I said to her that that, that I have frequent calls with you and and we go over things and, you know, you address any concerns I have. And and I and I've also told her that you guys just in general, you you have treated me very well oh, that's huge. That that's rare that you see that kind of generosity from from really anyone, you know, especially a company this. I don't think I'd ever encounter any other company that stepped up to the plate for the customer. So so I would just say you you really need to give them a try because they are legitimate.\n\nSo it's like anything in life. You don't have all the answers, but if it feels right, then the timing is right, take that jump that that leap of faith for me, it's always gonna feel that jump, that initial jump is always gonna feel scary. But when you have other people that have done it and said, hey, listen, it's gonna be okay. It's a lot easier.\n\nHaving heard testimonials from Cheryl and some of the other guys, I don't know their names, but that helped me a lot. And I hope that I know this helps somebody out there, but, but I'm a real person. I don't work for AT in the same vein. If this continues to do what it's doing, it literally is.\n\nFor me, I feel good about it. Those take a bite.\n\nSo here's the first thing that I would say is that for anybody who's been burned on something, I'm gonna be willing to bet that there were a couple of things that were in common on what they got burned. Versus they had to pay it pretty sizable fee upfront. And if they had any additional investments for inventory or whatever, they never got a chance to where they could physically verify or monitor those assets. So that's a huge difference here.\n\nYes. There is a fee up front to be part of this network, but anything that you invest as far as your capital, it is in your brokerage account in your name, you see it all the time. So if you don't like how things are going after a week or two, pull it out. You can't do that with any other opportunity.\n\nNow, yes, obviously, your fee has invested. Your fee sunk, but there's always a risk to play on any opportunity. And if you're if you're on the on the fence, nobody's gonna sit here and be like, oh, there's no risk involved. Of course there's risk involved.\n\nBut this one's panned out better than any of the rest of them.\n\nTry it. You you have to try it. If you don't try, you you'll you'll never know. I am proofs and silly this year, and I'm part of it.\n\nAnd this is better than working. This is better than working for someone or, you know, being in that rat race, this is better than an income. In my opinion, it's like it's like a worker bee that is doing stuff for you. And you don't have to do anything.\n\nAnd like I said, it's a godsend. I'm grateful. You have to try it. I say go for it.\n\nThere's no guarantee, but it's been guaranteed. And this is better than any other passive form that I've I've I've seen thus far, better than any other investment because it's actually paying and you're living but from my experience.\n\nSo Especially right now, the, you know, the economy is not doing well.\n\nAnd a lot of people having struggle, especially in income, if they did this program really do the what they have to do in the program is really gonna help them.\n\nI believe it should take a chance of this one. I know there's so many scammers or the, sort of, I don't say fake, but the to some program, many programs may not work so easily, as they promised ATN, the program of business that, gives a passive income and, as it was promised or maybe more promised return that, what we're getting. So, which is fantastic. Try this. Yeah.\n\nWell, I'd have to say anybody that gets involved in something like this has got to be willing to take it a chance. All this is, and if you're willing to take a chance, I think, in the long run, you and I, we all agree with you.\n\nHonestly, man, If it ain't no risk, it really ain't have no reward behind it. Because if you scam late on make not, you gotta be all in with this or do like most people If you're gonna put it on the market, if you're gonna invest it, make sure it's something that you're not gonna miss when you put it up.\n\nYeah. I would say it's a very, very good option. Very good option. We'll take action.\n\nBest thing about the program, at least how I had experienced it thus far as you have the opportunity to earn your money back relatively quickly. You could take that money out, and then you can then you can start playing with house money. There's no no reward without the risk. I think this is definitely worth the risk.\n\nSo think you definitely get the shot.\n\nSo, you know, you have the skepticism of it's too good to be true. I did my research. I test drove this. I've been test driving it just in my accounts alone. It it truly is. It it truly is is wondering.\n\nJust do it. Just send it and forget it. Just do it. That's it. Nothing. Yeah.\n\nJust do it like Nike. That's fine. Just set it and forget it. That's it.\n\nI just had that gut feeling with you that you were you were going to go to the end to to make sure you you didn't want people to have that feeling you had of a hundred grand loss and nowhere to go. So I just had the gut feelings. Why I chose to do this?\n\nI would say just do it to earn money on the first day.\n\nI'm not gonna say everybody would earn money on a first day, but the way it looks, everybody would earn a little something on the first day if it's set up correctly.\n\nSure.\n\nJust to do that, you don't find opportunities like this. It's it's fantastic. It's gonna come to earn money on that first day, that first week. And, actually, we were while we were sleep How much you owe?\n\nYou can't earn money wisely. What is your money doing now? Like, why are you looking at this video? You're looking for something more.\n\nTrust your loyalty. It takes money to make money. Number one, but I think a lot of people don't realize that. So that's that's the way it was with us, and we trust over the world.\n\nWe land in a spot. We land in a great spot. With with you and your company, we're going forward. So I I would say just to everybody, hey, if you're on the fence, I I hook yourself from the fence, go right through the fence, keep it moving.\n\nThis is the opportunity.\n\nSo with anything new, I was nervous. But again, in in anything that you're gonna venture into, you you almost have to do your research and and understand to a certain degree what you're walking into.\n\nI was skeptical and a little nervous too, but what sold me was I sent the joint to start my investment. I, wired fifty thousand dollars. Okay.\n\nBut it was from the wrong account because my aux account is a personal Yeah.\n\nAnd if fifty thousand came from a this business account.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd and what made what sold me, but you guys wasn't legit when you sent fifty thousand dollar back.\n\nI was way skeptical, and I've been burned before, like I said, by other passive income things, and then I've been scammed, scammed out of money online too. It was criped. So I was I was reading, reading nervous. But, I just took the leave of faith that Wait.\n\nWell, I mean, everybody's skeptical. And I pulled this to Henry. So you're telling me x, y, and z. Yeah.\n\nOkay. What what's the catch? It's like a young catfish or somebody. It it's one of those deals that it is that's gonna be true.\n\nSince this affiliate marketing wasn't working out. Most stocks were more work and things like that. I was a little skeptical at first. And I but then I thought, you know what?\n\nIt's just worth finding out more information. Right? So that's when I did whatever I did to contact you guys. Like, I'm doing some research to just thought that this you guys were worth the shot.\n\nDefinitely nervous and and skeptical just because, you know, there's so many different things out there. I've been scanned in a few different things over my lifetime from from people that I know. So when you're investing in things with people you don't know, I think the odds or the chances are that much greater, right?\n\nI wouldn't say skeptical because when I usually am skeptical, I don't really go through feel like, nah, I'm gonna I feel like this is the thing. I'll do it.\n\nNow, even if I fail at the thing, at least I like firming my decision, I I stand on Yeah.\n\nSo after that, a first initial consultation call, I was like, okay. I was like, this is this could be it right","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://atn.linkbuilderpros.com/case-study/?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script>

Hello. Hello. We are here. This beautiful private winery. I'm here with my beautiful White Brook.\n\nHi.\n\nAnd we're gonna be talking about what from a spouse's perspective. For a businessman and investor and somebody that's wanting to take care of his family, but we're gonna have somebody asking some questions to us. And let's go ahead and jump right into it.\n\nSo, bro, can you share about your background in your life before ATN success?\n\nSure. Yes. Before AT and T.\n\nWe were living in Arizona where I was a career nanny slash governance. We made the transition to move out to LA, which was very exciting, somewhat nerve wracking just to be in a whole new city, a big city, but we did it. And upon arrival, I took a position working to twelve hour shifts, both at five AM to six PM.\n\nFive five days a week, five days a week, which I love the kids.\n\nI love the family, and it was it was very exhausting. So that's what I was doing before ATN. Also, I just had a baby. So a lot of kind of life changes leading up to the start of ATN.\n\nAnd when it came to the start of ATN and that journey, how did you feel when Aaron started? Right? Especially given the ups and downs of entrepreneurship investing? Yes.\n\nSo I remember I was on a girls trip and I came home from this, like, great opportunity, like, this whole new field of work that I think this could, like, be a game changer for a fast forward from that point until the actual start of ATM, I was definitely a little nervous, a little unsure about the role that gonna take us. And we had big dreams for wanting to buy a home and just different things, and I wasn't sure if this was going to be compatible with our lives. But knowing him and who he was, I saw the passion. I saw the drive in him.\n\nAnd I was just like, alright. Let's try it out. Let's see what happened. So that was kind of my initial response.\n\nSo, bro, can you describe the moment when Aaron started getting success? And then you realized that you could actually retire from work and focus on your family full time.\n\nI think just once we realized, like, the monthly income that was coming in, it was kind of a shock like, oh, like, this is more than your actual nine to five corporate position, and then we made the decision to buy a home. And once we went, picked out the lot, picked out the home, paid the or deposit all the things that led up to it, I realized that retirement was a my near future, and I was very excited. And it was also agreed upon, like, once we left LA and moved to our home in Marietta, California, that I could, and I was very, very.\n\nSo was retirement for you always planned, or was it after the success.\n\nWe had a plan of that once we hit these, like, checkpoints that I could, like, be full time at home. And there was a time when we weren't sure when that was gonna happen, we have this plan. Thankfully with ATN, we were able to, like, hit those markers way faster than we plan to in which retirement happened way sooner than I was assisting. I think we had, like, thirty five. It was kind of like our target age for me.\n\nYep.\n\nWhen it actually came at twenty nine. Twenty nine. Twenty nine. So it was several years early.\n\nSo how has your life and daily routine changed since As I said before, I was working twelve hour shifts five days a week now, I am fully home with my kids, my two babies, which involves my daughter.\n\nShe has a huge social life. All her activities, I'm taking them to just different social gatherings, We're in a Osaco op preschool, which I gets volunteer at three meals a day home cooked, like, just all the things that I really wanted for a family, my family, I get to do now since I'm at home with them.\n\nLet me just jump in here and say that. So what she did with working twelve hours a day, like, I couldn't have done that. So to be honest, like, being in a position to not only have, like, a beautiful spouse, not only have somebody that supports my vision and and all those things, but also someone who has the work ethic. She had more work ethic and drive than I did.\n\nShe's been working since she's sixteen years old. So for me to see her work ethic made me push even further and harder to make sure that, like, I was able to not only hold up my end of the bargain, but actually, like, exceed that to be able to, like, oh, let her rest a little bit more. And that twelve hours per day put us in a position, that a lot of people may not be in to where you can actually catch up on all the debt that America puts you in with student debt and by having all of these costs of, like, car loans and and things like that. So for us, we had a huge goal of, paying off all of our consumer debt.\n\nWe were big into Dave Ramsey. We wanted to be debt free. We wanted to go on there and do the debt free screen per twelve hours per day. Got us out of debt.\n\nMy my eight hours per day stabilized us and made sure that everything was taken care of, but that really boosted us in it being able to say. So, of course, I appreciate that.\n\nWhat what has financial freedom brought into your life the most valued amount.\n\nJust tying back with the family with doing the things we love to do as opposed to working nine to fives or just long leaks, long hours, I get to plan my days and fill them with things that are fulfilling and things that we all love to do, though definitely time.\n\nHow is that with the extra time? How is how is that affected your relationship with your children?\n\nWell, they they've been very clingy lately, and it's because I'm homeless all the time. So it's it's great. Like, we're best friends. I'm building a very close bond with them.\n\nThey know Mama's there every day. They know Dida's there. I know he's just in his office, but he's there as well. Like, were present when we take him to all of their activities, Aaron joins as well, pick him up, take him to school, like, together all the time.\n\nAnd it's really beautiful to get to do that with my outside of your kids, are there any personal hobbies or pursuits you've been picking up upon since you have more time?\n\nYes. I've actually always wanted to open up my own in home child care. That was always a goal of mine. Though since I was able to retire from the Navy governess life, I actually got my license, and I'm fully licensed to do that.\n\nAnd that is kind of to come, but I have that ability, something I really was passionate about. And also, lately, I've been doing a lot more reading because I love to read and have found more time to do that. And just building more connections with family or sorry, Beaufortin. Coming out this way, I wanted to focus more in on building closer, stronger friendships, But now I have, like, a really big friend group and we do lots of different things together.\n\nThat's been really helpful.\n\nCan you explain your quality of life before ATN success? In your quality of life now?\n\nYes. Well, before AT and T success, we were more tired. Didn't see each other as often. I was commuting.\n\nHe was commuting in LA, which nobody knows about LA. It's hectic, it's crowded. That is the biggest thing. We were just tired.\n\nNow after ATN, we have financial freedom. We're doing more of the things that we always talked about doing trip vacations, activities for the kids, and we feel more rested. We feel like we're able to be more attentive to each other's needs and the kids' needs because, and we're not, I mean, we're not in the rat race. The grind everyday grind anymore.\n\nAnd then throughout Aaron's journey with ATN, how did you support him, especially during challenging?\n\nLots of prayer. I was, had my an open ear who's able to me about anything. I tried to give as best advice I could. This is a new, like, realm for me as well, just trying to help advise him in different areas and how to run the business how to go deal with people, etcetera, and just allowing him, like, space and time to get things new.\n\nSo she's one of four kids in a big family, like, all of her family lives like an hour north of here, which is why we moved from Arizona to Southern California in the first place. And one of the things, like, one of her, like, calling cards with the family, and she's the most rational one. That being said, so I get to benefit a lot from her wisdom and her advice and ability to be able to, like, understand what's actually happening and how she can, oh, give the best guidance or support that she possibly can. I don't have to, you know, constantly be talking with my teammates about all the things. I can, speak more maybe candidly or or whatever with her, and she can kind of give the advice from a personal spouse expected, which is always amazing.\n\nAnd then how did Brooks support impact your decision and commitment to ATN's vision and growth?\n\nIt it allowed for me, like I was mentioning in terms her her own personal growth, my decisions, like, based off of the books that I'm reading or the mentorships that I'm getting or masterminds that I'm part of those things, like, can be, like, outside of the norm for everyday people. Right? People that are stuck in the rat race, what's their non conventional ideas, non conventional strategies to make things happen. But ninety percent of those ideas or strategies or whatever, she understood the logic of those things, understood the rationale. So that allowed for me to be able to not only explain it easier for her to understand it more and then be able to implement or adjust my own strategy to, you know, take advantage of those opportunities So it's been amazing.\n\nNow with the success of ATM, can you guys both share a memorable moment where you started seeing the actual event?\n\nThere's a few, but one that I really, like, was excited about. We were on a trip on the coast. We just happened to go to a couple really nice stores.\n\nAnd I It goes to France, by the way. No.\n\nSo the the Californian culture start, and I happen to leave with some really nice purchases, some luxury items, exciting for me.\n\nJust just so you guys know, like, I'm I used to be pegged as cheap, but I like to say, a frugal individual.\n\nHowever, I had a focus and I had a vision of making sure that we got out of the rat race and we were able to get out of consumer debt. Again, listening to Dave Ramsey so much, like, I was a guest of disciple where I was just like, I wanna be out of the rat race. I wanna be debt free. So I was so focused, like, knew he was talking about the rice and bean diet, but I was like, we can't do rice and beans, but maybe we could just do some chicken and rice or something.\n\nLike, at least some pro like, some act like some some meat and some some rice. But, so that was kinda my my opinion. But we didn't go out to eat as much, or we didn't, like, go shopping as much. But I told her I made sure that she understood, like, if you could She she was a little hesitant.\n\nShe was like, we could do that and go on these vacations or we could do that and eat out when we want to.\n\nShe's being very, very freaky.\n\nAnd I was like, No. Let's focus. Let's lock in. I'm all about locking in. Right?\n\nBut with that, I was just like, no. Like, we if we just dedicate ourselves then in about a year or whenever we're actually out of consumer debt, then I'll be so much more comfortable to do all the extra things. Here we are couple couple, two, three years later, and we're doing all the extra thing, like, renting out a private winery.\n\nI have both of you guys grown since. What would you have to say to the other partner to say how much they've grown?\n\nOh, I would say, just grace overall for just, like, the process towards me, towards the kids, just understanding that, like, because he's got so much going on, he's building this business. When he's with us, he's gracious. He's gentle. He's kind. And he just takes a lot of pride in, like, being with us once he has that moment to be with us.\n\nThat's That's a really great area of growth for you.\n\nI say the area growth for you, like I was mentioning is your wisdoms. Basically, like, all the things that I'm learning, like, you're the sounding board for a hundred percent of all the stuff that I'm learning. So you by proxy of your your husband who is pushing himself to learn as much as possible and develop as much as possible that's one of the things that I get to share with you, you digest, and then your, you know, your wisdom grows, your, ability to understand what what all is happening actually grow, you become an even stronger partner. So that's that's very helpful.\n\nAnd as a couple has personally experienced the benefits of ATN, what message or advice would you give would both like to give to potential customers considering joining the network?\n\nI would say well, first I would say go for it. It is really life changing.\n\nHaving first of all, having my husband home and present, I wouldn't trade it in for anything else in the world So from a from a spouse's perspective, right, your husband is going into different opportunities, right, what would you say to a wife or spouse that's in a similar position where their husband is looking to these platforms, wanting to change your life through passive income, right, and to present the opportunity into their spouse.\n\nWhat what words would you give them?\n\nI would just say, like, that are the source, like, who are you speaking to, on this? And, like, Aaron and the rest of his partners, they're all very honorable individuals. They the whole point of this is to make sure people are getting into something that will benefit them. So I would say definitely consider that. And If all of those boxes are checked, I would highly recommend that you go for it, encourage them through it.\n\nObviously, stay present in the discussions of it So that you are well, aware informed of what's happening, but it will it can change your life.\n\nI would I agree.\n\nWhat I always do is just make sure, like, what I do to benefit me in these conversations is to make sure that she's a part of it, right, in the first place, to make sure that they're actually on the call so that they're not just I'm not just relaying information, and I'm the secondhand source of, like, what's actually important and the things that are needed to know. So some things may resonate with her on those you know, calls rather than they do with me. So it's just important to if you can have your, another decision maker that's needed, to be on the actual call itself to both be informed.\n\nAnd if there needs to be a follow-up, both of you guys are on there, and for all of you guys get your questions answered, So that that's probably my biggest thing is to make sure you guys are as together as possible on the decision. And with you, as a couple of the chief financial freedom, what is the shared goal that you guys have moving forward You're looking at it.\n\nThis three plus million dollar house on a on a winery and all that. So I was like, look, I wanna open this up to the public. Like, Why can't we, you know, have people come through, have wine, enjoy themselves, but you're like, no. Let's keep it private for the family for special occasions. I'm like, we could make some money too, but but so this so this is what you're looking at. Right?\n\nThis this is the ultimate dream for us to build a home in wine country have a vineyard.\n\nHe wants the actual winery. Who knows? But, this is the dream. That's one of our dreams, and also just to travel. We wanna spend a couple months here and there in different countries flooring with our kids, lots of activities for our kids.\n\nI would say those are the those are the goals here in the next couple of years.\n\nBut all of those things are very relative. Right? Because we've already built I dream. We've already built, like, it is relative.\n\nRight? Again, what we've already done is we've already built a home Yeah. That we've designed and but we've put the finishing touches on and all of those things. So that's already happened.\n\nWe already we're going to Africa in a couple of weeks. We'll spend a month there. Gonna be in Columbia again in a couple of months. We'll spend a few weeks there.\n\nSo we're already doing those things. It's just more of all the stuff that we wanna, any, at a higher level.\n\nAnd add on the binary.\n\nMore for sure.\n\nAnd another goal of ours is we wanna be able to, like, to different foundations, to different situations, like, that's a big part of our heart with financial freedom with Well, giving back. So we've talked about different foundations, different ways we can do that. So that's really high on our priorities.\n\nOkay.\n\nHow did I forget because So you're talking about all the other things.\n\nYeah.\n\nCause later, we're gonna talk about immediately personal stuff. Okay. Fair enough. Right? I wanna I wanna build water sources and Africa, so my dad is from Ghana.\n\nWater sources there. Oh, educational institutions there. And then also the part of this, like, we wanna travel the world. We wanna see all these things we could travel California.\n\nWe could travel the United States and all those things that oh, I wanna impact Africa with so many benefits or impact medellin with so many benefits of, like, we'll we'll provide for this food bank, or we'll provide for this orphanage. But if there are people in Marietta, Temecula that need this type of impact as well. So that's one of the things for us. We really paid attention to as well.\n\nSo those are those are extremely important for us.\n\nTo end this off, what is the one thing you love the most about the significant part?\n\nHer eyes, please need her smile. Her support, her big brain. You could think it's more. But give me a sec. You go. It's time for you to do this.\n\nWell, I've always at the beginning. He's made me laugh, like, no other. That was, like, one of the main things that attracted me to him. Also, he's tall dark and handsome as you can see, and his intel, like, he's always from the very beginning been so smart and I knew that that was gonna lead him to, like, lead your success. That's proven the way he bothers our children. That is really inspirational. So those those are my top.\n\nDo you have any final words to the couple that's in the position where they're interested in ATM or they're just wanting to get to know you guys more any final words?\n\nTalk to these people. They're awesome. If you talk to them, you get to know them. I think you'll you'll understand, like, that this is a great to, though, if you're hesitant, if you're considering, get one of them on the line, don't answer questions. They're very personable. They take the time to get to know you to answer questions.\n\nSo that would That's pretty much it.\n\nBut book a call, there's a link in the description. That's that's pretty much it. You guys understand. But anyways, we appreciate you guys watching.\n\nOh, this is one of the things that's been in the works for a long time. I've had to convince her time and time again to get on camera and kinda let tell her story, but now we finally did. I had to rent a winery to do it, but but we were able to make it happen. So enjoy it because it probably won't happen again.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://atn.linkbuilderpros.com/case-study/?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script>

The truth is they don't always win. This is what leads people to losing money. By joining ATN, you're getting access to a machine learning trading algorithm that has a human trading team behind it.\n\nSo the traders will step in manually when needed to prevent bad trades from happening. This is why no one can compete with the results that we get for our clients. A bot can make you money, but a trader with experience will help prevent you from losing money. You need both to win in the long term.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://atn.linkbuilderpros.com/case-study/?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script>

We call this our passive income protocol. Step one, our team will instruct you on how to send your capital to the regulated brokers that we use. Step two, We show you how to get access to our private trading account and take advantage of our proprietary algorithmic trading bot, which is managed and overseen by our private trader.\n\nStep three. Your money has been pooled with other members of the network and you're paid in proportion to the amount of capital you allocate. For example, if ten thousand dollars is allocated and the overall profit is ten percent, Then the gross profit would be ten percent of ten thousand dollars or one thousand dollars before the trader's performance fee. Step four.\n\nYou then receive a deposit into your brokerage account based on the profits generated of course, after the trader has taken their performance fee, which you can then use as passive income or compound back into your trading balance. Now I'm gonna give you a live look on the inside of exactly how this looks and how you can take advantage of truly passive income. Let's do it. Okay.\n\nSo this is a live look inside of one of our active accounts. So as you can see, so this is actually called my FXbook it's a way for us to be able to have a third party, verifier, you know, so that way, you know, everybody is is on the same page and it's transparent in terms of what the actual results are. You see overall there's been a ninety one percent gain on this account. The total balance on the account is just above seven point two million.\n\nTotal profit just above two point four million dollars. You can see the deposits just under eight million withdrawals just under, just above one point five million dollars. So you can see, you know, everybody is able to log into here be able to, as I mentioned, to be transparent and see exactly what's happening, you know, the gains for the month, gains for the week. You guys can actually see all of those things as far as the percentages.\n\nAre concerned. And then you can kind of go over and also take a look at what the, you know, win loss ratio actually is. You can see it's a seventy thirties, just above seventy percent for longs and seventy percent for shorts. So that means that, you know, in terms of all the trades that are, that are gotten into, an average of about seventy or seventy one percent of those trades are actually one.\n\nSo you can also see, you know, one of the things here as well. Just just so you know, this we always and constantly update our trading strategy. The traders are constantly evolving and, you know, you can't rely on the same strategy for, you know, years and years. So they constantly update their strategy.\n\nSo you can see this strategy here started in August. And then right away it started producing exactly what we expected at above fifteen percent, just under fifteen percent, just under seventeen percent, and then a amazing month for the month of December to close out the year at just about twenty two and a half percent. So all of these things are here for you guys to be able to take a look at exactly, not only how transparent this is, but how everything is performing. And so if you're if you're interested in knowing exactly, how all of this works, you know, you're going to be able to hear exactly how it works with our advisor.\n\nYou'll be able to ask ask me the questions that you do have.

I lost a hundred k in several different automation programs and so did our clients. Sometimes you have to accept that you're gonna get your heart broken a few times before you find your light part.\n\nIt's same concept here. This seems a bit too good to be true. How do I lose? Here's what other automation companies say.\n\nOh, we don't fail, or there's no way of failure, but here's the truth. The bots we're using will fail why doesn't a company like Apple fail? It's because they constantly have updates. If they just stayed on iOS one, we wouldn't have FaceTime.\n\nWe're up to iOS seventeen today. So they've had iterations to stay current over the last fifteen years. So in Apple fashion, the traders we use update strategies to stay effective in the market. How much do I have to invest to start?\n\nIt depends on the package you choose. We have packages that can go all the way up to over one hundred thousand dollar. How does ATN handle periods of market downturns or unfavorable trading condition? Our software is unemotional and picks up news that affects trading.\n\nSo if it appears that it isn't a good day for trading, it literally won't take any trade Our traders, like any high level investor, work on the idea of capital preservation first and profits second.

I was always been a point where we invested into something that is gonna be one thing. It's actually not. Right?\n\nSo coming into this, I wanted the my money priority to consider results for these clients, and is really what it's tried for. I've been in the other side where you got promised one thing. It didn't really deliver to that or fell right under the bar, and I just wanted to fix that for the time. From your perspective, what actually makes a successful client with a team?\n\nCommunication and understanding, but more importantly, expectation, right, making designs feel that is not really so hard to get something done as long as it's exactly worth the momentum. In that in that regard, so the interactions that you have is it kind of like, does it have to be every day, or does it is it ultimately weekly monthly? How does that actually look? No.\n\nNo. So it's very simple.

As far as, like, where I will come involved with is anything that you need from there on or any questions or any concerns that you have is really right at your fingertips. You can reach out to me, get in contact could even get in a Zoompa, right, and then get everything down from there.\n\nA hundred percent. Love that. So one of the things that most customers do say is, like, you're so responsive. You're so dedicated to their success.\n\nAnd being able to, it'll be there when they actually need you. So what do you feel like that comes from? Like, why are you so dedicated to these clients? And again, I've been through of these programs and the way to communicate is even.\n\nSo you have all these questions, send that email out, get a response. If it's the same day, maybe a couple of hours later, there's some questions that wasn't answered. Now you have to do a branding email, send that over, come back, and that's just so I promise myself that I was not gonna any client go through that and make sure that they have somebody to actually be in contact with and answer the questions and go above and beyond you. You do go above and beyond from for you to view that, is it just based off of your own experience of what you didn't wanna see happen?\n\nOr, of course, of course, it's exactly like understood But can you give an example of, like, when you face an off, like, particular scenario where somebody needed something maybe more than what you were normally accustomed to giving to clients as far as more attention, as far as more detail or things like that. So that's exactly where I added the fact for doing some calls to one of my ways of helping, because this was one particular client that just we didn't know exactly what they were doing as far as onboarding. We're asking some stuff if they didn't weren't able to kinda understand exactly what it was.\n\nSo I was like, well, I have some time right now. I'm able to hop on him so he has the time as well. When they got on, I just had to share the screen. I know exactly what it was, where the mistake was, and it was something so simple, but I wouldn't have known because we weren't able to explain it correctly.\n\nBut if I'm able to see it right in front of me, I can identify exactly what's wrong and just fix that issue right That's one of the things for me as well. Like, when I was working as a counselor, when we didn't have Zoom, we have to use phone calls. And phone calls for people that aren't really tech savvy or able to articulate like you just mentioned, the ability to, like, be like, hey, like, I'm having this issue or this is what this, you know, this is saying or things like that. It's hard to be able to help them.\n\nSo for us, we're bringing it into the twenty first century by using Zoom and being able to share screens, which has been a lifesaver to make our job so much simpler to be able to help people that we do. So that's actually not the part of your So for you, like, for potential customers listening, can you walk us through, like, the puts the process for, like, potential new clients that actually do and enjoying. Right. So it's very simple.\n\nOf course, it depends on which package it is, but it is quite similar to one another. All we're gonna need is really a few documents from the client, where they need to have ready, and it's simply just to make as small as possible once everything is already there. So what what happens is, we will get you into the program, we'll fill up some documents, and then I'll walk you through some of the key points that's needed. But more importantly, what exactly since that went this journey with us and making sure that we under promise and over deliver on what we hundred percent.\n\nWhat are some of the common misconceptions or maybe the challenges that clients do have with ATM? Like, how do you, how do you ultimately address them? So the main misconception is people thinking that they need a deep tech set for some reason. Right?\n\nLike, they don't understand computers, and that's completely okay. Again, it's where the Zoom call comes in. So we're able to get you into the call, get you to share your screen, with your permission, if you like, I can even control your screen and do some of the things with writing. But, I do want you to actually go through it.\n\nI would advise on what to do. Get that most memory. Once you get it done once or twice, you're able to take care of it right then after. But even so, we're able to also, with our client portal, have those step by step process Right?\n\nSo in the future, you can use that directly. A hundred percent. That's one of the best things about working with you in the process because once you explain it, you you make what's so complicated actually super simple to understand, and that's been, like, one of the pieces of feedback that I constantly get, about how they how they interact with you. So, again, excellent work there.\n\nHow does ATM, like, actually help clients with the the necessary tools, the training to be able to provide the top knowledge client support? I think the main thing is having somebody to actually get in contact with because for the most part, is canceled. So it's not much thing that they need to do on their end. So having the that person actually speak to and and questions still and be able to deliver on those a lot more important.\n\nThere are and depending on the pack package, of course, there are some times that you do have to do some little treats yourself But, again, once you do it once, twice, maybe even three times, then you're able to do that repeatedly, you're constant. With that, like, can you actually describe, like, the importance of building relationships because what I've seen, they contact you and then afterwards, I may follow-up with them for testimonial or just kind of myself contacting about having a point of contact And I'm like, my last question to them is, do you you need anything else? You need any how how's everything in terms of your experience going?\n\nAnd they're just like, no, I'm good. No. Thanks for for reaching out, like, talking from from my perspective. Thanks for reaching out.\n\nBut, like, now Julio's taking care of everything. Julio's doing. Julio already last week helped me with this and help me with that. So for you, like, you know, can you describe of value building personal relationships with his clients?\n\nWell, you'll make it very easy because I think we've done a good job of setting a expectation for us, kinda we wanna bring in. Wanna bring in people that we love to work with and and then benefit each other. So the the advice that we do get, it's a very easy to form that relationship, being able to be more than just, business park. Right?\n\nSo even to the point with a lot of the times, if if they find out that I'm around their area, they even invite me to have to come over and, like, I'll have a more of a one or more religious even though we haven't had the chance to take anybody on that offer, but it's just the fact that we're already there. Right? It's not just, like, you're working for me or I'm working for you, etcetera. Is is more of a kind of family oriented.\n\nNo. A hundred percent. For that regard, like, again, that's so much different than a lot of other companies that I've that I've been a part of and and experienced in this space as well. But what do you feel like sets us apart from other client service relationships?\n\nI'll have to go back to that. Like, I feel like it really is the communication and expectation aspect of it. We tell him one thing as far as probably solves what to expect, but for the most part, we overachieve that. Right?\n\nSo and we do that for a reason because it's a it's a lot worse if you have, like, some kind of numbers in mind, and it just go below that. But if a property is something lower and then you get free, four times a little bit more than that, so so the perfect scenario, give us a specific example, like, you don't have to, maybe if you have a name of a client, but, like, give us an example of a client where it's a memorable interaction and it's just like, man, this is amazing and something that that left like an actual impact on feel like there is a few, but for the most part, it's those that have done some kind of animation services before, and not specifically just fully automated, but some kind of like business they are some industry out there that you basically get coached and you you do the job yourself, right, so expect the results in either one of those areas, those kind of clients that come from that background, they can just see it.\n\nIt's not a day, right, because they're they're so used to the pile of things to work. And then coming, not moving from there to gear, it's just so more seamless. So it's, like, it's a bigger impact. In terms of, like, actual feedback.\n\nRight? We understand how important feedback is, three sixty feedback, us giving, and the feedback on client interactions and getting feedback from actual clients themselves. On things like that. What do you feel like is actually, like, how does ATN do you feel incorporates that feedback into our operation?\n\nRight. So I'm it's very important for that. For the clients to communicate that with us. And I feel like they do that for the most part when they're in an onboarding call with me.\n\nRight? They sound like that middle ground. So when they get on the call, they let us pay that email of what they like on say par or either how hard or simple something could be, and they will make some suggestions on how to make a little bit better. So we do a good job of listening to those feedbacks.\n\nAnd actually implementing it into the platform, whether that's within the onboarding process or a way for them to reach out to somebody or what they have to do on a day to day from their So give me an example. So, for example, that's where the whole sharing the screen will come into play. Right? Because from one particular person, it kind of very difficult to one even join us, right, because talk about somebody that never uses computers.\n\nSo it's good to have patience, with those individuals and get them on the call. Once they're there, then you're able to leave their controller screen with their with their permission, and then actually not do it for them, but walking through a little bit better. Because it's a difference of telling, yo, click on this one here, and they're like, okay, which one? I'm not sure.\n\nAre they gonna get a little frustrated? But if you're managing it and explaining what you're doing as to going slowly, then they get to to understand, like, just not that. One of the things that that I've noticed about you as well, again, is your responsiveness to clients, and you'll actually take calls as late as, like, ten PM your time. And I'm like, I'm already off, chilling with my kids.\n\nLike, I'm not doing anything else, but you're you're grinding away, what, making sure these clients get all the things that they need. How do you manage with the work like balance? Well, I don't do that. A hundred percent of the time.\n\nRight? I do like to say it for the most part, I do, mostly available, but for those times that I'm not, it's just a simple some people are on social media to transfer the phone, so I'm replying to technical feedback. So, but it's not that far to actually be getting trashed back with the client. For that aspect, If I'm not able to attend to that phone call, you just schedule a SIM card.\n\nBut if I am available, I don't mind getting back in the computer and just helping them out and making sure everything's taken care of. A hundred percent. Again, I appreciate that. I know our clients do as well.\n\nSo are there any, like, personal principles that you use or adapt to, like, make sure that you stay on track with your efficiency and any routines that maybe help you with that? Yes. So I do use a tool that one of our staff member created to keep me organized and efficient throughout the whole process. And that's going to be the big impact when it comes to balancing my work and life balance, because I I love the fact that I have, like, no deputies and heaps of that take a lot of my attention away.\n\nSo I wanna make sure that I give them my attention, and then also take care of your clients are at the same time. I love that. Yeah. No.\n\nYou're you're so great with our kids. It's it's so funny that, like, right away, it became it came to my house because this is the first time that you that you come to to my place in Southern California, even though this is somewhere that we're meeting with the team, and then you'll have the summit. So this isn't my actual home, but when you when you landed and you came to my home, you, you met my side. You were spending more time looking at him and talking to him than you were talking to me at first.\n\nSo I was like, wait a second now. I'm the guy. Right? I'm what's happening here?\n\nBut now that you're you're so great with kids. So and I can see why your patience is so amazing. So where do you actually see the future of client support and, you know, success actually for for ATN going forward. I see it growing, though.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the feedback and compliments that I'll get from yourself and the clients, doesn't just take one person to Right? So the future on this is having more individuals appear as much, right, for client success or importantly results as well that are able to add value to what we're currently that's one of the things that, obviously, we're facing in the goal that we do have. It's ultimately to be able to, not only create the seven figure results that we already have, but again, bigger results and ultimately non figure results as well. So being a result oriented to business, the number one focus, but client success client actual of satisfaction is also some that's helpful as well.\n\nIn terms of the aspirations that you personally have to be able to enhance the experience that clients have with us, do you have any of those things in mind? I'm I'm a client myself. Right? I have my own funds invested into some of our platforms.\n\nSo I I get to see some of the things that I feel like can be improved. Those are some things that I bring to the team as well as far as suggestions. Also, some of those comes from the clients themselves. Right?\n\nThings that maybe I didn't notice that they did, and that will help us integrate it into the platform and make it that much better. Right? There's always way to improve. You're actually you've been a a part of this company for years now in terms of being able to take advantage of of the offerings that we've had that you're putting your own capital, can you talk to us about that experience in terms of?\n\nFirst of all, I had no idea that was even possible to to level. There's there's doing things one way that doing it right. Right? So when you open my eyes to this opportunity as far as, like, what we're specifically doing here, it's just taking to another level.\n\nIt's just you seeing let it get your own rips. Right? So with that being said, your profit, right, and you're doing it in a way where you don't have to put too much hands to this, which is the best combination because, like, your time, you get your time back, right, you get a little bit more of what you were expecting, right, and be able to leverage that and help others change your circle advantage of the same stipulate. Hundred percent.\n\nI love that. For our current clients or any future clients as well, do you have anything specific that that you would wanna in part before we get off of here? What I would say is if you're not there yet, just continue to do your research. Right?\n\nWe're not in a position where we're looking to convince anybody of this. This is basically self explanatory, but I would really consider or suggest for you to be doing your research. You would find out what the other side would be, right, and understand, like, why this is, like, to the point where we are hundred percent. And how can clients actually best utilize the support the resources that ATN provides to make sure that they are successful?\n\nJust saying to no. It's okay if you wanted to have things hands off, but the more they talk about what you're investing in, the more doors will open for you. Right? Because you're able to use that.\n\nI mean, not only understand, like, what the platform is doing. But you can only you can also, like, learn from that industry and kinda, like, diversify your support level. No. That makes sense.\n\nSo bonus question, right, off the vineyard here. Why do you believe in I I've known you for a couple years, and you put your money with your mouth. You're not only, like, that kind of person that tried things out, but you try things out. Right?\n\nLike, you invested many different industries I believe you done at Amazon Automation, trucking automation, and they all said the same thing that I've even explained, right, which are promising one thing but under delivering on it. That's really what attracted me to join what you currently joined here. I believe we're seeing the same value in that regards, and I I only see it growing from here. Love it.\n\nCool. Alright. Until next time, people, appreciate your brother.","potentialAction":{"@type":"SeekToAction","target":"https://atn.linkbuilderpros.com/case-study/?wtime={seek_to_second_number}","startOffset-input":"required name=seek_to_second_number"}}</script>
