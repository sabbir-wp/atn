Hello. Hello. We are here. This beautiful private winery. I'm here with my beautiful White Brook.\n\nHi.\n\nAnd we're gonna be talking about what from a spouse's perspective. For a businessman and investor and somebody that's wanting to take care of his family, but we're gonna have somebody asking some questions to us. And let's go ahead and jump right into it.\n\nSo, bro, can you share about your background in your life before ATN success?\n\nSure. Yes. Before AT and T.\n\nWe were living in Arizona where I was a career nanny slash governance. We made the transition to move out to LA, which was very exciting, somewhat nerve wracking just to be in a whole new city, a big city, but we did it. And upon arrival, I took a position working to twelve hour shifts, both at five AM to six PM.\n\nFive five days a week, five days a week, which I love the kids.\n\nI love the family, and it was it was very exhausting. So that's what I was doing before ATN. Also, I just had a baby. So a lot of kind of life changes leading up to the start of ATN.\n\nAnd when it came to the start of ATN and that journey, how did you feel when Aaron started? Right? Especially given the ups and downs of entrepreneurship investing? Yes.\n\nSo I remember I was on a girls trip and I came home from this, like, great opportunity, like, this whole new field of work that I think this could, like, be a game changer for a fast forward from that point until the actual start of ATM, I was definitely a little nervous, a little unsure about the role that gonna take us. And we had big dreams for wanting to buy a home and just different things, and I wasn't sure if this was going to be compatible with our lives. But knowing him and who he was, I saw the passion. I saw the drive in him.\n\nAnd I was just like, alright. Let's try it out. Let's see what happened. So that was kind of my initial response.\n\nSo, bro, can you describe the moment when Aaron started getting success? And then you realized that you could actually retire from work and focus on your family full time.\n\nI think just once we realized, like, the monthly income that was coming in, it was kind of a shock like, oh, like, this is more than your actual nine to five corporate position, and then we made the decision to buy a home. And once we went, picked out the lot, picked out the home, paid the or deposit all the things that led up to it, I realized that retirement was a my near future, and I was very excited. And it was also agreed upon, like, once we left LA and moved to our home in Marietta, California, that I could, and I was very, very.\n\nSo was retirement for you always planned, or was it after the success.\n\nWe had a plan of that once we hit these, like, checkpoints that I could, like, be full time at home. And there was a time when we weren't sure when that was gonna happen, we have this plan. Thankfully with ATN, we were able to, like, hit those markers way faster than we plan to in which retirement happened way sooner than I was assisting. I think we had, like, thirty five. It was kind of like our target age for me.\n\nYep.\n\nWhen it actually came at twenty nine. Twenty nine. Twenty nine. So it was several years early.\n\nSo how has your life and daily routine changed since As I said before, I was working twelve hour shifts five days a week now, I am fully home with my kids, my two babies, which involves my daughter.\n\nShe has a huge social life. All her activities, I'm taking them to just different social gatherings, We're in a Osaco op preschool, which I gets volunteer at three meals a day home cooked, like, just all the things that I really wanted for a family, my family, I get to do now since I'm at home with them.\n\nLet me just jump in here and say that. So what she did with working twelve hours a day, like, I couldn't have done that. So to be honest, like, being in a position to not only have, like, a beautiful spouse, not only have somebody that supports my vision and and all those things, but also someone who has the work ethic. She had more work ethic and drive than I did.\n\nShe's been working since she's sixteen years old. So for me to see her work ethic made me push even further and harder to make sure that, like, I was able to not only hold up my end of the bargain, but actually, like, exceed that to be able to, like, oh, let her rest a little bit more. And that twelve hours per day put us in a position, that a lot of people may not be in to where you can actually catch up on all the debt that America puts you in with student debt and by having all of these costs of, like, car loans and and things like that. So for us, we had a huge goal of, paying off all of our consumer debt.\n\nWe were big into Dave Ramsey. We wanted to be debt free. We wanted to go on there and do the debt free screen per twelve hours per day. Got us out of debt.\n\nMy my eight hours per day stabilized us and made sure that everything was taken care of, but that really boosted us in it being able to say. So, of course, I appreciate that.\n\nWhat what has financial freedom brought into your life the most valued amount.\n\nJust tying back with the family with doing the things we love to do as opposed to working nine to fives or just long leaks, long hours, I get to plan my days and fill them with things that are fulfilling and things that we all love to do, though definitely time.\n\nHow is that with the extra time? How is how is that affected your relationship with your children?\n\nWell, they they've been very clingy lately, and it's because I'm homeless all the time. So it's it's great. Like, we're best friends. I'm building a very close bond with them.\n\nThey know Mama's there every day. They know Dida's there. I know he's just in his office, but he's there as well. Like, were present when we take him to all of their activities, Aaron joins as well, pick him up, take him to school, like, together all the time.\n\nAnd it's really beautiful to get to do that with my outside of your kids, are there any personal hobbies or pursuits you've been picking up upon since you have more time?\n\nYes. I've actually always wanted to open up my own in home child care. That was always a goal of mine. Though since I was able to retire from the Navy governess life, I actually got my license, and I'm fully licensed to do that.\n\nAnd that is kind of to come, but I have that ability, something I really was passionate about. And also, lately, I've been doing a lot more reading because I love to read and have found more time to do that. And just building more connections with family or sorry, Beaufortin. Coming out this way, I wanted to focus more in on building closer, stronger friendships, But now I have, like, a really big friend group and we do lots of different things together.\n\nThat's been really helpful.\n\nCan you explain your quality of life before ATN success? In your quality of life now?\n\nYes. Well, before AT and T success, we were more tired. Didn't see each other as often. I was commuting.\n\nHe was commuting in LA, which nobody knows about LA. It's hectic, it's crowded. That is the biggest thing. We were just tired.\n\nNow after ATN, we have financial freedom. We're doing more of the things that we always talked about doing trip vacations, activities for the kids, and we feel more rested. We feel like we're able to be more attentive to each other's needs and the kids' needs because, and we're not, I mean, we're not in the rat race. The grind everyday grind anymore.\n\nAnd then throughout Aaron's journey with ATN, how did you support him, especially during challenging?\n\nLots of prayer. I was, had my an open ear who's able to me about anything. I tried to give as best advice I could. This is a new, like, realm for me as well, just trying to help advise him in different areas and how to run the business how to go deal with people, etcetera, and just allowing him, like, space and time to get things new.\n\nSo she's one of four kids in a big family, like, all of her family lives like an hour north of here, which is why we moved from Arizona to Southern California in the first place. And one of the things, like, one of her, like, calling cards with the family, and she's the most rational one. That being said, so I get to benefit a lot from her wisdom and her advice and ability to be able to, like, understand what's actually happening and how she can, oh, give the best guidance or support that she possibly can. I don't have to, you know, constantly be talking with my teammates about all the things. I can, speak more maybe candidly or or whatever with her, and she can kind of give the advice from a personal spouse expected, which is always amazing.\n\nAnd then how did Brooks support impact your decision and commitment to ATN's vision and growth?\n\nIt it allowed for me, like I was mentioning in terms her her own personal growth, my decisions, like, based off of the books that I'm reading or the mentorships that I'm getting or masterminds that I'm part of those things, like, can be, like, outside of the norm for everyday people. Right? People that are stuck in the rat race, what's their non conventional ideas, non conventional strategies to make things happen. But ninety percent of those ideas or strategies or whatever, she understood the logic of those things, understood the rationale. So that allowed for me to be able to not only explain it easier for her to understand it more and then be able to implement or adjust my own strategy to, you know, take advantage of those opportunities So it's been amazing.\n\nNow with the success of ATM, can you guys both share a memorable moment where you started seeing the actual event?\n\nThere's a few, but one that I really, like, was excited about. We were on a trip on the coast. We just happened to go to a couple really nice stores.\n\nAnd I It goes to France, by the way. No.\n\nSo the the Californian culture start, and I happen to leave with some really nice purchases, some luxury items, exciting for me.\n\nJust just so you guys know, like, I'm I used to be pegged as cheap, but I like to say, a frugal individual.\n\nHowever, I had a focus and I had a vision of making sure that we got out of the rat race and we were able to get out of consumer debt. Again, listening to Dave Ramsey so much, like, I was a guest of disciple where I was just like, I wanna be out of the rat race. I wanna be debt free. So I was so focused, like, knew he was talking about the rice and bean diet, but I was like, we can't do rice and beans, but maybe we could just do some chicken and rice or something.\n\nLike, at least some pro like, some act like some some meat and some some rice. But, so that was kinda my my opinion. But we didn't go out to eat as much, or we didn't, like, go shopping as much. But I told her I made sure that she understood, like, if you could She she was a little hesitant.\n\nShe was like, we could do that and go on these vacations or we could do that and eat out when we want to.\n\nShe's being very, very freaky.\n\nAnd I was like, No. Let's focus. Let's lock in. I'm all about locking in. Right?\n\nBut with that, I was just like, no. Like, we if we just dedicate ourselves then in about a year or whenever we're actually out of consumer debt, then I'll be so much more comfortable to do all the extra things. Here we are couple couple, two, three years later, and we're doing all the extra thing, like, renting out a private winery.\n\nI have both of you guys grown since. What would you have to say to the other partner to say how much they've grown?\n\nOh, I would say, just grace overall for just, like, the process towards me, towards the kids, just understanding that, like, because he's got so much going on, he's building this business. When he's with us, he's gracious. He's gentle. He's kind. And he just takes a lot of pride in, like, being with us once he has that moment to be with us.\n\nThat's That's a really great area of growth for you.\n\nI say the area growth for you, like I was mentioning is your wisdoms. Basically, like, all the things that I'm learning, like, you're the sounding board for a hundred percent of all the stuff that I'm learning. So you by proxy of your your husband who is pushing himself to learn as much as possible and develop as much as possible that's one of the things that I get to share with you, you digest, and then your, you know, your wisdom grows, your, ability to understand what what all is happening actually grow, you become an even stronger partner. So that's that's very helpful.\n\nAnd as a couple has personally experienced the benefits of ATN, what message or advice would you give would both like to give to potential customers considering joining the network?\n\nI would say well, first I would say go for it. It is really life changing.\n\nHaving first of all, having my husband home and present, I wouldn't trade it in for anything else in the world So from a from a spouse's perspective, right, your husband is going into different opportunities, right, what would you say to a wife or spouse that's in a similar position where their husband is looking to these platforms, wanting to change your life through passive income, right, and to present the opportunity into their spouse.\n\nWhat what words would you give them?\n\nI would just say, like, that are the source, like, who are you speaking to, on this? And, like, Aaron and the rest of his partners, they're all very honorable individuals. They the whole point of this is to make sure people are getting into something that will benefit them. So I would say definitely consider that. And If all of those boxes are checked, I would highly recommend that you go for it, encourage them through it.\n\nObviously, stay present in the discussions of it So that you are well, aware informed of what's happening, but it will it can change your life.\n\nI would I agree.\n\nWhat I always do is just make sure, like, what I do to benefit me in these conversations is to make sure that she's a part of it, right, in the first place, to make sure that they're actually on the call so that they're not just I'm not just relaying information, and I'm the secondhand source of, like, what's actually important and the things that are needed to know. So some things may resonate with her on those you know, calls rather than they do with me. So it's just important to if you can have your, another decision maker that's needed, to be on the actual call itself to both be informed.\n\nAnd if there needs to be a follow-up, both of you guys are on there, and for all of you guys get your questions answered, So that that's probably my biggest thing is to make sure you guys are as together as possible on the decision. And with you, as a couple of the chief financial freedom, what is the shared goal that you guys have moving forward You're looking at it.\n\nThis three plus million dollar house on a on a winery and all that. So I was like, look, I wanna open this up to the public. Like, Why can't we, you know, have people come through, have wine, enjoy themselves, but you're like, no. Let's keep it private for the family for special occasions. I'm like, we could make some money too, but but so this so this is what you're looking at. Right?\n\nThis this is the ultimate dream for us to build a home in wine country have a vineyard.\n\nHe wants the actual winery. Who knows? But, this is the dream. That's one of our dreams, and also just to travel. We wanna spend a couple months here and there in different countries flooring with our kids, lots of activities for our kids.\n\nI would say those are the those are the goals here in the next couple of years.\n\nBut all of those things are very relative. Right? Because we've already built I dream. We've already built, like, it is relative.\n\nRight? Again, what we've already done is we've already built a home Yeah. That we've designed and but we've put the finishing touches on and all of those things. So that's already happened.\n\nWe already we're going to Africa in a couple of weeks. We'll spend a month there. Gonna be in Columbia again in a couple of months. We'll spend a few weeks there.\n\nSo we're already doing those things. It's just more of all the stuff that we wanna, any, at a higher level.\n\nAnd add on the binary.\n\nMore for sure.\n\nAnd another goal of ours is we wanna be able to, like, to different foundations, to different situations, like, that's a big part of our heart with financial freedom with Well, giving back. So we've talked about different foundations, different ways we can do that. So that's really high on our priorities.\n\nOkay.\n\nHow did I forget because So you're talking about all the other things.\n\nYeah.\n\nCause later, we're gonna talk about immediately personal stuff. Okay. Fair enough. Right? I wanna I wanna build water sources and Africa, so my dad is from Ghana.\n\nWater sources there. Oh, educational institutions there. And then also the part of this, like, we wanna travel the world. We wanna see all these things we could travel California.\n\nWe could travel the United States and all those things that oh, I wanna impact Africa with so many benefits or impact medellin with so many benefits of, like, we'll we'll provide for this food bank, or we'll provide for this orphanage. But if there are people in Marietta, Temecula that need this type of impact as well. So that's one of the things for us. We really paid attention to as well.\n\nSo those are those are extremely important for us.\n\nTo end this off, what is the one thing you love the most about the significant part?\n\nHer eyes, please need her smile. Her support, her big brain. You could think it's more. But give me a sec. You go. It's time for you to do this.\n\nWell, I've always at the beginning. He's made me laugh, like, no other. That was, like, one of the main things that attracted me to him. Also, he's tall dark and handsome as you can see, and his intel, like, he's always from the very beginning been so smart and I knew that that was gonna lead him to, like, lead your success. That's proven the way he bothers our children. That is really inspirational. So those those are my top.\n\nDo you have any final words to the couple that's in the position where they're interested in ATM or they're just wanting to get to know you guys more any final words?\n\nTalk to these people. They're awesome. If you talk to them, you get to know them. I think you'll you'll understand, like, that this is a great to, though, if you're hesitant, if you're considering, get one of them on the line, don't answer questions. They're very personable. They take the time to get to know you to answer questions.\n\nSo that would That's pretty much it.\n\nBut book a call, there's a link in the description. That's that's pretty much it. You guys understand. But anyways, we appreciate you guys watching.\n\nOh, this is one of the things that's been in the works for a long time. I've had to convince her time and time again to get on camera and kinda let tell her story, but now we finally did. I had to rent a winery to do it, but but we were able to make it happen. So enjoy it because it probably won't happen again."}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"174bd2","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"174bd2","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true}},"options":{}};
