What's going on, people, Aaron Richards, are here with my wonderful mom, Kim Richards, and I'm here because, we're in Metagene Columbia, and I was able to help my parents and afford to be able to be down here because of making twenty thousand dollars a month in passive income. But, of course, I didn't actually start there. I was, you know, burned by automation.\n\nI lost six figures ultimately. I'm trying to, you know, figure out how to earn passive income. A lot of my journey has all kind of led me to where I am now and how and why I created ATN. But of course, like, you know, a lot of people that I talk to, a lot of clients or prospective clients that I to, they actually ask, why don't you have a hundred thousand followers on social media or why aren't you acting like, oh, that you have Lamborghinis or renting out mansions and things like that?\n\nWell, ultimately for me, was raised. I don't wanna compare myself too much, but I was raised differently than that. Right? And that's not ultimately going to actually help me take care of my family or help in that regard.\n\nSo one of the reasons why I wanted to be able to come on here and and talk to to my mom and have a quick conversation was because I want people to understand where I came from and how I got things started why I have the mindset that I do to have multiple streams of income, but without further to talk about, let's go ahead and introduce Kim Richards.\n\nThanks, Aaron. I was born and raised in a town right outside of Cleveland, Ohio, continued my education to become an engineer and then work for an amazing company, General Electric, for ten years. I've been married for forty years to Aaron's dad, and kind of halfway in between those forty years, my husband, developed Parkinson's disease.\n\nAnd when that happened, we had to make some serious decisions he was working full time at in the pastorate and had to go into a forced retirement and the board of directors decided to give him a severance packet. We thought it was a pretty generous severance packet, but found out that due to the cost of health care in America, that money kinda dwindled really fast. So thank god. I had always been raised by my mom in a single parent household where you don't put all your eggs into one basket.\n\nSo I learned early on to have multiple income streams. But we had these multiple income streams, but we were faced with this health challenge. So we spent a lot of money, hundreds of thousands of dollars in the United States, and then to learn that you know what, and we would consider going outside of the United States and looking at some alternative health care systems that are superior to America that our funds could last longer. We that's how we had landed up in, Medellin, Columbia.\n\nWe've been here now for eight years. Through Erin kind of adapting early gone, a good understanding of personal finances, and a good understanding of passive income He has now afforded my husband and I the opportunity to be able to retire comfortably because of this opportunity that his company, provides.\n\nWell, I appreciate that type of credit, of course. But a big part of the reason why I was focused on finances and understanding that I was actually in a rat race was because you gave me some advice just before I got married. And, actually, it's crazy. So right here, like, eight years ago, I came down here by myself I was with Brooke at the time.\n\nLike, we were dating or whatever at the time. I came down here after I actually got let go of a corporate position. I was laid off but they gave me, severance package as well. Right?\n\nIf I came down here, I was chilling. I was like, oh, man, I got several thousands of dollars. I'm like, twenty four or twenty five years old. So I just wanted to set goals.\n\nI wanted to, like, really, like, make sure that I was intentional about all the money that I had and then also the next direction It was down here where I decided to become a counselor. It was down here where I decided to marry Brooke. And then I was down here where I asked my mom about what do you feel like of the things that I should be learning about or some of the things that I should study, what should I like to take, like, as a next challenge? And she was like, you need to learn more about personal finance.\n\nAnd I was like, well, and actually the specific way you said it was, you need to study money. I was like, money. What do you mean? Like, I already know how money works.\n\nYou get a couple dollars. Right? You spend, or you save a couple you spend a couple. Right?\n\nLike, whatever. So I was like, I already know how money works. I've been seeing money for my whole life at that point, twenty five years. But I went down a a a really long self study of money, and that is what ultimately developed me into being able to ultimately leave the rat race after making six figures, and then figure out how to be more of a entrepreneur, a self sufficient contributor to the market.\n\nSo, of course, that really helps with where we're at right now. Now with that being said, you know, how would you describe my journey from your perspective, after, like, I kind of went into the professional world?\n\nNo. I got a real set story to tell. Well, the reason why I come to focus on finances, because at that time, we had set up a trust fund for them. And I had met with them right that's right before we came over here.\n\nI met with them and I told them, gave them all three and I told them what they were gonna get, what they were gonna inherit. But as of July of this year of twenty three, my husband outlived all of his insurance. They had to forfeit it. Their inheritance is really cut in half.\n\nHe's outlived it. Outlived it. So policies that we were paying a hundred and fifty dollars a month for, we had to pay four thousand dollars a month for it. And we had a family meeting.\n\nIt was, like, let them go, mom, but that was that was their inheritance. So you need to have another stream.\n\nYou gotta have some other stuff going on in your life Kim, based on your experience, because Aaron shared from his side of you, he came here.\n\nHe was given under a lot of guidance. He's able to stand on your shoulders for advice. But what was it from your perspective as far as inborn eyes own money journey, but also you having to wear multiple hats during this time because that's not really being mentioned. You had five streams of income, but you're also a caretaker of your husband who sit. So can you elaborate a little bit more on that aspect?\n\nI think the the journey has been how can you continue to grow in life?\n\nContinue to meet life's challenges and continue to allow your children to be the best that they could possibly be under the shadow of taking care of someone with a chronic disease. So my husband now has had the Parkinson's for twenty years My primary goal was for Aaron and his siblings to be able to continue to grow and become their own person. So having that in mind, I've always had multiple income streams so I can kinda go to this bag or that bag. For their continuing education for their purchasing of their own homes. So always making sure that there was income available in the house.\n\nSo I think you kind of decided to have, like, a bucket of, like, a one stream of income was for this.\n\nOr Yes.\n\nDiversified.\n\nSo one stream was for the Children's Education.\n\nOne stream was for purchasing of real estate. Another stream was for vacations. Another stream was for purchasing automobiles. But just make sure that there was always a nice flow.\n\nBut like I stated, when the health care crisis came up, then these buckets kinda were shut down a little bit because I had to now divide my time to take care of my husband. So you have time and energy, and then also trying to take care of myself, making sure that I might say this. I don't know if I can say it on camera, but then I didn't gain five hundred pounds. And that I still had a good quality of life for myself as well.\n\nSo it's balancing and what, how this impacted Aaron. I always wanted him to be able to be his own offend itself and make sure that he was able to grow and to advance, emotionally, financially, spiritually, in all areas of his life.\n\nWhen it comes to Eric, what was some moments in his journey that Oh, he's really taking life seriously. He's actually really following my actual guidance of advice, and he's not just brushing it off and being a delinquent son.\n\nIt's just making the And, actually, I I I believe when Aaron went to Grand Canyon University, I think that really changed his life.\n\nSo, for example, he took a job where he was, working at at night, and then he would just was doing online classes before online classes was really popular. And that's how he got his, bachelor's degree. And then I did a challenge for him to continue on, to get his masters. I think this is important for ATN.\n\nI think people need to know your educated. Okay. You they don't believe that. Even though I'm an educator, they're like, it doesn't matter, mom, but yes, it does.\n\nSo He continued his education.\n\nAnd in continuing his education, he began to look for other ways, other income streams for himself.\n\nWith the higher education? Like, what made you do that?\n\nSo why I followed her advice with higher education is because I saw that she was making six figures. And then I saw that my sister who so my older sister, she's four years older than me. My brother is, like, a year and a half older than me. So I've seen them as far as, like, when they graduated college, like, they were able to eventually, like, find a good jobs that we're making, I don't know, like, just under six figures or whatever because, of course, you're not gonna necessarily start.\n\nYour professional career making that amount, so to speak. So I saw that. I was just like, alright. Well, I wanna be able to have a good baseline of income.\n\nBut that was one of the biggest reasons why I was like, alright. Let me buckle down and eventually get my bachelor's degree. I was really, like, challenging my self with education because I had a tuition benefit that said if you had an a, you would get a hundred percent tuition, paid for. If you had a b, you get ninety tuition.\n\nIf you gotta see, you get eighty percent tuition paid for. And I'm like, so then you're saying that I could get a hundred percent of myself paid for as long as I get paid, but that's why I graduated suma cum laude because I was absolutely motivated to actually get those grades. So not only for the education portion as far as like what it could do for my, like, professional career, but also I took it as a challenge. I'm a pretty competitive person.\n\nSo that was, like, one of the biggest things there.\n\nAnd that he so he's so he kinda got his momentum going academic And then when he took his job at the university, they said, well, if you hit this certain target performance wise, you could work from home. This is way from before remote work was even possible in America. So they would give him incentives. He was just killing He's just killing it.\n\nOh, I can work from home. One day, if I hit this goal right here. Oh, I can work from home two days if I hit this goal right here. So I think those things are very important in life.\n\nThe same way if you are a person that's trying to increase your financial base and invest with ATN, this is the type of mindset that you have to have. There has to be a goal. And then you just begin to climb and climb and climb and climb and climb and climb. And that's what Aaron has done.\n\nDid study did your whole sub study phases on finances because a kit. Right?\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd then tell us what you did differently with the day Ramsey's self education.\n\nWell, yeah. I mean, so like we're talking about being competitive. Okay. Like, alright. So I'm challenged to learn more about finances.\n\nI'm challenged to learn more, like, to to develop more in that regard. So I was like, alright. What can I do? How can I take this?\n\nLike, how can I take this and really excel with it? I just went to YouTube university. Right? So that's where everybody has to go and get started.\n\nStarted listening to Dave Ramsey. Right? So some people call him Steve Ramsey, but, you know, and, you know, for him and and she was, like, big into Susie orman and stuff like that, but they're they're both kind of almost cut from cloth in that regard. That's kinda where I got my start as far as understanding about finances, personal finances.\n\nAnd then I graduated to Robert ASaki and the rich dad poor dad and everything like that. It started off with just understanding that you needed to be able to control your debt or and control your expenses And then you really, like, at the same time, my mindset was being an offensive player. Right? I'm gonna focus on increasing my income as well.\n\nSo some people just focus on decreasing their expenses when I was focusing on increasing my expenses at the same time. Right? So creating that gap to where ultimately I was able to have enough money to pay for a paying down my debts, and that's when the story of me and Brooke in Venice in six hundred square foot apartment. So just grinding away during COVID and paying off all of our consumer debt because of our belief in following a date Ramsey, And then ultimately, we grabbed, like, we were at a point where now we have more income coming in than our, like, massively more income coming in than we actually needed to put out that allowed for us to save a good amount and then be able to have the opportunity to purchase our first home, which in Southern California, we were living in LA, and it's a million dollar market, right, first buying your first home.\n\nIt's a million dollars, right, in Los Angeles. So we decided to take advantage of the fact that we had we were remote, but we were able to somewhere. That was a little bit more affordable, but my mom was able to step in and challenge us as well. Right?\n\nYou when you issue me a challenge, then I'm gonna take it and I'll decide to overcome it So or take advantage of it. If she issued a challenge and said, we'll match whatever you're gonna contribute to your home as a down payment, which motivated me even more to have that capital to do it, which ultimately, that led to me, like, having my first real taste of, like, capital, like, a a solid amount of capital because now I had equity. Was when the housing prices were just before the boom that happened in, like, kind of twenty twenty, twenty twenty one. So she helped me get into a house that helped me get equity And then now all of a sudden I had the ability to take a HELOC and use capital in order to start to generate more.\n\nSo that was kind of like the lessons that I learned from some of the books that I was reading and some of the information that I was getting from these financial experts. So that was really helpful.\n\nAlways your side seeing him go from your young son to now becoming a young man.\n\nI think when I saw Aaron, like I said, when he took off academically. And then when I came down to visit him and Brooke and saw how he managed his job, I said, this dude is a beast. Oh my god. He's got skills.\n\nYeah. I guess that was like the old lady e's dropping or something like that, but it was like, he's got skills here and with all three of them, I've always been like Go. Go. Go.\n\nGo. Become your best self. Do what you wanna do. Do it with integrity.\n\nDo it with, authenticity, being yourself, and then the sky is the is the limit. You can do whatever you wanna do. And then So when I was watching him perform his job, then I would say, well, Aaron, you know, you probably could do this or you probably could try that. And then he would he'd kinda chill. Like, he's got a real chill kind of personality, and then he would just think about it. And even from a little boy, now the mama stories, But a little boy, all he had to do was look at something.\n\nAnd he was like a toddler and his siblings were older, but he just looked at it one time and jumped up and then he was walking He was riding a bike. He was doing this or that. He just looked at it just one time, did it real good, and then he was out.\n\nThe one thing I've noticed is that you've been supportive throughout his whole journey. You're not it doesn't seem like of the mothers that you can't do this and that you don't understand.\n\nNo. Not at not at not at all. We have three children, and they're all different. And I and I've always wanted him to be the leader.\n\nHe was a mischievous as a a young boy, but what I would tell the teachers is he's a leader. I need you to challenge him. Need you to motivate him. I need you to provide him something else.\n\nHe's bored. Give him something else to do. And then there's a truck around our house. So when they were young, kinda between seven to ten, learned early on, they couldn't say that they were bored.\n\nBecause if they said that they were bored, they had to close the phone up, they had some dishes to watch, they had a grass, So grass outside the cut. Early, they learned how to entertain themselves, how to motivate themselves, but he's carried that on.\n\nOh, you're bored. I'll give you something.\n\nYou did something to do. That's what you need to take.\n\nSo is that what led to transitioning to also the ATN success was challenged by one of my peers, right, in the, I went into digital consulting.\n\nI met, an individual who was, like, oh, he wanted me to come work for them at a company that he was a sales leader at we'll saw some something in me to be able to, like, come on and, like, eventually become a sales leader for that team. And I I got on the team, and I was just like, I'm not really interested in, like, just working commission. I wanna, like, I wanna have an ability to, like, okay, great. I I work.\n\nI I I make commission. I make sales or whatever it is, but then I also wanna have the streams of income coming in, or that are passive preferably that I'm using my capital to be able to, oh, grow. What I noticed was, after I kind of, like I said, that I didn't really want to take that role, he was like, oh, man, but we gotta figure out something. How are we gonna work together?\n\nHow are we gonna do this? And I was just like, well, I do have something that is working for me right now. And maybe I could kind of talk to my friends and talk to my family about it, get a proof of concept make sure that what actually works for multiple people, but if it works, then, hey, we can actually, I'll promote this and I'll actually start to provide this opportunity to other people. Right?\n\nThat was one of the things at that point. I was kinda challenged by him to figure out how we could actually work together, and then eventually it grew into, like, okay. Great. Like, it works for friend, it works for family.\n\nAnd then now we have something an an opportunity to be able to spread it to spread it to a lot more people.\n\nSo I wanna pick up on this. Was it part of your pastoral upbringing and counseling role. I had all the children tested when they were young. He tested in the area of to being a counselor.\n\nBeing that type of, a servant leader like that. He's flowing in his natural gifting. I remember when he called me to tell me about this peer wanting him to come over to this other side. And then he kinda let me know, mom, I think I'm gonna go out on my own.\n\nI'm gonna go out on my own. And then, kinda like within six months or a year of that conversation. So he told me he says my intentions are to help you with dads. Health care expenses.\n\nHe says it's gonna take me a year to two years to be able to do it, but I want to be able to help with that direct expense.\n\nAnd then he said in another conversation, you know, so you want to retire. How long is it, how long is it going to take? And I said maybe about two years or something like that. He says, no, what's the gap?\n\nWhat's gonna be the gap between, what you're making now and when you retire? So I gave him that gap number. He says, No problem. Mom retire when you wanna retire.\n\nI said What?\n\nI kept that in the back of my mind, kept chugging away, giving him time to build the business and to grow and to and to make adjustments. And then his family was growing as well, you know, things like that. And so, but now the day is here. I'm gonna be retiring this year and by the end of the year, He's he's positioned. He's he's set, and I'm grateful.\n\nSo I also wanna show you, like, ask from your perspective. Right? Because I know you talked a little bit about the social media thing, but I don't think people realize how important it is. To know what's the main thing.\n\nRight? You focus the main thing, which is taking care of your sons and also wearing multiple hats. Right? You kept it the main thing.\n\nRight? And then also for you, that's exactly how you're translating into business, but I wanna hear from your perspective. Right?\n\nYeah. So, I mean, originally, like, as a kid on millennial. Right? I'm gonna be on social media or whatever, and it's gonna be like, you know, high school, early college days.\n\nBut eventually, because I was still, you know, chasing a football dream and trying to figure stuff out. I didn't really, like, focus as much on school as I should have. I was kind of just, like, doing, like, kind of, like, part time school and, like, not really being serious. And so what that ended up being was me, like, I was kind of left behind a little bit.\n\nI was twenty one twenty two, and I'm seeing all of my friends graduate from college of how am I seeing that? I'm seeing it on social media. So I'm just like, Man, like, you know, the studies have shown, like, at, like, years after I I really was off the social media. It's like, hey, like, oh, that really affects your dopamine level like it could be, like, it could lead to depression if you don't get a certain amount of likes or this about or this or whatever.\n\nSo I was really, like, before I got to the point where I was like really feeling depressed or whatever, I just got off social media at, like, twenty two. So from my twenty two to, like, twenty like, thirty. Right? I really got back on social media in order to, like, really just started with LinkedIn.\n\nAnd then, of course, of starting this business, you kinda have to have some sort of social media presence. So for a whole pretty much decade, I was off social media. I didn't really care. I didn't really place too much value on it because when I started making six figures at what, like, twenty seven or whatever it was, like, should I get back on?\n\nShould I get an IG now? So should I flex now? Should I, you know, like, you know, get a nice watch and, you know, show that, or should I, like, get a nice souped up maxima and show that. Right?\n\nLike, what should now should I do that? But it was just like, no. Like, if I didn't care about it and then why would I care about it now? Right?\n\nThat's a big part of why I don't really care to be in front of the camera. I'm just like, look at this. I'm there. I look at that up there.\n\nOh, oh, look at this. Right? So that's not really how I wanna do things, or I don't wanna, like, go buy a Lamborghini, not to, like, flex or anything, but I could buy a Lamborghini in cash right but that's something that I'm not going to do because I understand the importance of building assets. So Lamborghini is not an asset.\n\nRight? That's a extremely lie extreme liability. I know people that have, like, Lamborghinis in these super cars. And they're like, oh, it's always in the shop, and, oh, it's always this or that.\n\nIt's like, you know what I mean? Like, those are first world problems, but not even, like, a really useful liability, even a bill it is. Right? So for me, I've always focused much more on the substance of something, rather than the artificial, superficial, or kind of flash of it all.\n\nSo that's a big reason why I'm not really big on social media like that. So really, ultimately, the majority of my time that I spend on a daily basis is with my clients and with my executive team figuring out the best way to perform, figuring out the best way to produce results for them, because ultimately for our business, that's the number one most important thing. Client's results in satisfaction.\n\nSo shout out to Julio from being a satisfaction king. Julio is our onboard specialist. He's the person that he's the success manager. Ultimately, so everybody's favorite person to be able to meet after me, of course, they'd meet him.\n\nAnd then they're able to just like, oh, man. Like, you're such a patient person. You're able to help me. So easily, if you're able to walk me through these things and you're so available, So it's a team effort and ultimately, again, just what I spend all of my time focused on when it comes to, like, specifically ATM related things.\n\nIs ultimately just client success.\n\nSo how do you think Aaron's success and what he's found with ATN is helping you prepare for your official retirement I I think what Aaron is doing by collectively bringing a group of talented people together and providing, client fulfillment at the highest level is what's critical here because there are lots of conversations that are going on social media and on YouTube just on all these different platforms, but who's really executing?\n\nWho's really producing?\n\nSo A lot of people aren't producing.\n\nThat's what I That's it.\n\nTrying to execute. Who?\n\nThat's that's fine. I mean, So some of us, like, being in the space a little bit more that most people don't realize about the industry. Right? Like, these people that have a million followers, like, it doesn't determine how much money you have in the bank or how much how many assets you have in your portfolio.\n\nLike, we know plenty of people that have a million followers that, you know, can barely make ends meet and they're living a well above their means. So for me, I wanted to not live well below my means, but definitely still prioritize the things that are actually important, which are actual assets and cash flowing assets to be specific. You know, focusing on cash flowing assets leads to being able to have more income than you need for your immediate circumstances. My immediate circumstances are my wife and my two kids.\n\nRight? But in order to be able to make the impact that I wanna be able to spread some of the the resources that I have to the ones that I love the most, of being able to help my mom in way. And then, of course, helping my dad as well on take some pressure off of them has been, like, it's an intrinsic thing. It's amazing.\n\nI I'm really thankful to be able to do it. But I I do feel like that's a part of, like, you know, me being a man and me being b man. She hurt you heard her say that I was a leader early on. Even though I'm a youngest, I definitely have always felt as though, like, it's on me.\n\nRight? So now that's what it is.\n\nAnd, Kim, this is a fun question for you. Okay. But what are you most proud of when it comes to hair?\n\nJust get it done. Like I said, from a little boy, saw it and just would just do it. Just get it done. The the the execution.\n\nYeah. So when it comes to parenting, because it seems like you did a great job, also to not allowing from my take on it doesn't seem like you allowed your emotional stress. Which your husband getting sick also affect the family because it's regardless of, like, a very emotionally turbulent time.\n\nI intentionally did not want them to experience any of that.\n\nI wanted them to be able to their debt, became ill when they were in high school. So I wanted them to be able to complete high school wanted them to be able to complete college.\n\nEven though the Aaron's brother asked me. He was a sophomore at Arizona State. Did you want me to come back home? Do you want me to help to stay home with you.\n\nI said, nope. I want you to go back to school and graduate from college. So I'm just, I guess a proud moment is I'm just glad that he's completed his education and has a beautiful family and now wants to reach back and say, Hey, thanks, mom. Hey, thanks, dad.\n\nI'm really that makes me very, very, very proud that he's a generous person and that he wants to help others. You know, he doesn't he doesn't wanna just be the the the head guy and then not help anybody the way he's taking care of you guys here on this trip, you know, the way he takes care of his siblings, He has a, a, a first cousin that he's helping out. Yeah. That makes me proud, willing to help others.\n\nThat's what the Richard is all about. Now we get ours, we're gonna help you get yours, and we're gonna help you keep yours. And that's why I wanted him to study money so that he didn't understand. It's not just about making money, but keeping money.\n\nAnd then it's about also blessing other people with your resources.\n\nSo a really well known order once said, what good is first class if my homies can't sit. So it's a big part of what I'm about.\n\nI think where's my little notebook on here? And that purple notebook over here talking about raising successful millennials. That's what I'm really You you you want to raise the kids where that they are successful in their own right, in their own areas but then they also have a passion to give back and to support others.\n\nOf course, you reach back into your immediate family You reach back for your parents, but then others. We are our best self when we're serving. When we're serving other people, that's when you're gonna experience fulfillment.\n\nTo know that, my son has achieved some level of success, and he's willing to help me to retire any moment that I want to retire is going to supplement to know that his dad has, outlived his insurance policies, outlived his, severance packet that he he's worked fifty years of his life, but now he's outliving all of it because of an an illness that he can no longer work, and he has a mind to want to help the family. This is what success is all about. It's just not about keeping money upon yourself, but we are our best when we're helping others.\n\nSo what advice do you have to those parents would just say aspirations?\n\nSo at age forty, I invested in personal finances. I was familiar with Dave Ramsey and Susie Orman. Those were the gurus at during my time, What I'd like to say to every young parent in raising successful children is teaching them the core values of I'm gonna get I might get church here with you guys, but loving your neighbor as yourself, but love yourself.\n\nHelp yourself, but help others, and then continuing to set goals and challenge yourself. Okay. You've accomplished this. Okay.\n\nNow, step it up. Step it up. Step it up. And then while you're stepping up and while you're growing, lift up other people, teach the children how to give back.\n\nTeach the children how to go into neighborhoods that don't look like their neighborhoods and help help people, teach the children with money management with allowances and with chores with other opportunities. But the main thing is the giving back portion.\n\nHelping someone that's not gonna ever be able to help you helping those and doing it on a regular basis.\n\nHow does it sound like, like, the fear or, I guess, pressure consuming you at all.\n\nI never thought about it like that. It never dawned on me at all. That's why now we're having a family meeting and everything. We didn't know we were gonna be here for eight years, but we knew that economically it was going to allow our money stretch and to go further.\n\nWe knew that their health care system was good. We just we're people of faith, just taking steps of faith, leaps of faith. And believing and trusting in god that it's all gonna work out. It's all it's all it's all gonna be good.\n\nFor fear, some people call it false evidence of things appearing to be real, but I'm not concerned with fear at all. Not not at all. And it's about the goal setting. It's about, hey, what do we wanna do?\n\nAnd then Erin, like I said, he's like, let's go, mom. Let's go. And that's just kinda how we kinda I raised them and they grew up, and they were exposed to some really good, environments.\n\nSo So for me, with fear, I take it as a challenge.\n\nYeah. Because it's more of, like, alright, when you're faced with adversity, like, how do you respond? Right? You could either run the other way.\n\nYou could try to go around it or you could go through it. Like, and that's I choose mostly to go through it. Right? If it makes if it's not an opportunity to go around it while, like, allowing for me to really get past it and not just like, alright.\n\nNow it's just sitting on my side. Right? I I still have to live with it and and everything like that. So I would rather go through it if that's what it's meant to be.\n\nI I'm never gonna run from it. So that how that was instilled was because I saw her, you know, face adversity all through her life and my dad face adversity, especially, when he was, what, a diagnosed twenty plus years ago. So that was one of the things that I saw from them. And for me, I knew that I wasn't going to just succumbed to something that I feel like was just a challenge and opportunity for me to get better.\n\nRight? You get better through a struggle. You get better through adversity. So that's what I felt.\n\nBecause the reason why I mentioned fear is because you could've been fearful when you guys went into an automation package together, and it didn't work out.\n\nHundred percent. She was one of the the reasons why I was trying to get passive income as well, because again, I was wanting to be able to help them, right, and helped myself as well, but I wanted her to have the opportunity to see real passive income. She had multiple income streams, but they were all active sources of income. And so when I went to her and was like, hey, like, I think I there's an opportunity here that we can, but really make some passive income, I think that this could work She was supportive and she was like, I think that, well, let's go ahead and try it.\n\nLet's see if this works out. And, of course, that one did not work out, but She never blamed me. She never was, like, angry with me or, like, oh my gosh, we lost. Like, she has an investor's mentality as well.\n\nAnd just in the way of, like, hey, we tried something. That didn't work, but just basically just keep going. Keep trying to figure things out. She she's always been like, alright, like, what, like, That happened.\n\nWhat's next? How do you respond? What's the what's the next move? Right? What's not? Oh, getting knocked down and staying down, and she's gonna coddle me and give me a blanket and, like, oh, read me a story on the ground.\n\nRight? She's like, alright. So that happened. Alright. Like, and, you know, let's go ahead and get up.\n\nLet's start to walk again, and that's always been a a part of, you know, how I've grown up. And now that's what I'm instilling with my kids. So when talking about, like, passive income and, like, how we failed in the automation space at first, we still needed to actually find passive income So on the next video, we'll go ahead and dive a little bit deeper on exactly how we were able to get past the failed automation experiences and end up on the other side of it. To where now we're able to, you know, pay a a pretty, high amount as far as expenses, but also live very comfortably in, you know, the cities that we want to live in.\n\nSo you can check that out over here."}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"174bd2","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"174bd2","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true}},"options":{}};
