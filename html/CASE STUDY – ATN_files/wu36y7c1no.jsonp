So we are here in beautiful Southern California with my client success manager, Julio Romero, the one and only Everybody's favorite. How you doing today, Julio? I'm doing well.\n\nThank you for having me here. I'm gonna ask a few questions just to kinda make sure that, everybody's on same page with exactly how you help our clients. All of our clients always rave about you. You've been a part of our testimonials.\n\nThey've sent you your name multiple times. So wanna be able to bring you out to the public, make sure everybody knows all the great work that you actually do. Appreciate that. Appreciate it.\n\nIf you can just give us a brief introduction of who you are, what your background is, and why you actually came to be a part of May city. So my name is Sonia. Been known you for quite some years now. They'll The reason that I came into here is that I've been a client to different automation platforms and companies.\n\nYou have similar experience to me. I was always been a point where we invested into something that is gonna be one thing. It's actually not. Right?\n\nSo coming into this, I wanted the my money priority to consider results for these clients, and is really what it's tried for. I've been in the other side where you got promised one thing. It didn't really deliver to that or fell right under the bar, and I just wanted to fix that for the time. From your perspective, what actually makes a successful client with a team?\n\nCommunication and understanding, but more importantly, expectation, right, making designs feel that is not really so hard to get something done as long as it's exactly worth the momentum. In that in that regard, so the interactions that you have is it kind of like, does it have to be every day, or does it is it ultimately weekly monthly? How does that actually look? No.\n\nNo. So it's very simple. But once you do get into our program, we'll do a simple onboarding where that will look a few steps meeting with me, go through a few steps depending on which factors you're getting to, and it's very simple from there. Now after you get that done, it's for the most part, handsaw.\n\nYep. Right? As far as, like, where I will come involved with is anything that you need from there on or any questions or any concerns that you have is really right at your fingertips. You can reach out to me, get in contact could even get in a Zoompa, right, and then get everything down from there.\n\nA hundred percent. Love that. So one of the things that most customers do say is, like, you're so responsive. You're so dedicated to their success.\n\nAnd being able to, it'll be there when they actually need you. So what do you feel like that comes from? Like, why are you so dedicated to these clients? And again, I've been through of these programs and the way to communicate is even.\n\nSo you have all these questions, send that email out, get a response. If it's the same day, maybe a couple of hours later, there's some questions that wasn't answered. Now you have to do a branding email, send that over, come back, and that's just so I promise myself that I was not gonna any client go through that and make sure that they have somebody to actually be in contact with and answer the questions and go above and beyond you. You do go above and beyond from for you to view that, is it just based off of your own experience of what you didn't wanna see happen?\n\nOr, of course, of course, it's exactly like understood But can you give an example of, like, when you face an off, like, particular scenario where somebody needed something maybe more than what you were normally accustomed to giving to clients as far as more attention, as far as more detail or things like that. So that's exactly where I added the fact for doing some calls to one of my ways of helping, because this was one particular client that just we didn't know exactly what they were doing as far as onboarding. We're asking some stuff if they didn't weren't able to kinda understand exactly what it was.\n\nSo I was like, well, I have some time right now. I'm able to hop on him so he has the time as well. When they got on, I just had to share the screen. I know exactly what it was, where the mistake was, and it was something so simple, but I wouldn't have known because we weren't able to explain it correctly.\n\nBut if I'm able to see it right in front of me, I can identify exactly what's wrong and just fix that issue right That's one of the things for me as well. Like, when I was working as a counselor, when we didn't have Zoom, we have to use phone calls. And phone calls for people that aren't really tech savvy or able to articulate like you just mentioned, the ability to, like, be like, hey, like, I'm having this issue or this is what this, you know, this is saying or things like that. It's hard to be able to help them.\n\nSo for us, we're bringing it into the twenty first century by using Zoom and being able to share screens, which has been a lifesaver to make our job so much simpler to be able to help people that we do. So that's actually not the part of your So for you, like, for potential customers listening, can you walk us through, like, the puts the process for, like, potential new clients that actually do and enjoying. Right. So it's very simple.\n\nOf course, it depends on which package it is, but it is quite similar to one another. All we're gonna need is really a few documents from the client, where they need to have ready, and it's simply just to make as small as possible once everything is already there. So what what happens is, we will get you into the program, we'll fill up some documents, and then I'll walk you through some of the key points that's needed. But more importantly, what exactly since that went this journey with us and making sure that we under promise and over deliver on what we hundred percent.\n\nWhat are some of the common misconceptions or maybe the challenges that clients do have with ATM? Like, how do you, how do you ultimately address them? So the main misconception is people thinking that they need a deep tech set for some reason. Right?\n\nLike, they don't understand computers, and that's completely okay. Again, it's where the Zoom call comes in. So we're able to get you into the call, get you to share your screen, with your permission, if you like, I can even control your screen and do some of the things with writing. But, I do want you to actually go through it.\n\nI would advise on what to do. Get that most memory. Once you get it done once or twice, you're able to take care of it right then after. But even so, we're able to also, with our client portal, have those step by step process Right?\n\nSo in the future, you can use that directly. A hundred percent. That's one of the best things about working with you in the process because once you explain it, you you make what's so complicated actually super simple to understand, and that's been, like, one of the pieces of feedback that I constantly get, about how they how they interact with you. So, again, excellent work there.\n\nHow does ATM, like, actually help clients with the the necessary tools, the training to be able to provide the top knowledge client support? I think the main thing is having somebody to actually get in contact with because for the most part, is canceled. So it's not much thing that they need to do on their end. So having the that person actually speak to and and questions still and be able to deliver on those a lot more important.\n\nThere are and depending on the pack package, of course, there are some times that you do have to do some little treats yourself But, again, once you do it once, twice, maybe even three times, then you're able to do that repeatedly, you're constant. With that, like, can you actually describe, like, the importance of building relationships because what I've seen, they contact you and then afterwards, I may follow-up with them for testimonial or just kind of myself contacting about having a point of contact And I'm like, my last question to them is, do you you need anything else? You need any how how's everything in terms of your experience going?\n\nAnd they're just like, no, I'm good. No. Thanks for for reaching out, like, talking from from my perspective. Thanks for reaching out.\n\nBut, like, now Julio's taking care of everything. Julio's doing. Julio already last week helped me with this and help me with that. So for you, like, you know, can you describe of value building personal relationships with his clients?\n\nWell, you'll make it very easy because I think we've done a good job of setting a expectation for us, kinda we wanna bring in. Wanna bring in people that we love to work with and and then benefit each other. So the the advice that we do get, it's a very easy to form that relationship, being able to be more than just, business park. Right?\n\nSo even to the point with a lot of the times, if if they find out that I'm around their area, they even invite me to have to come over and, like, I'll have a more of a one or more religious even though we haven't had the chance to take anybody on that offer, but it's just the fact that we're already there. Right? It's not just, like, you're working for me or I'm working for you, etcetera. Is is more of a kind of family oriented.\n\nNo. A hundred percent. For that regard, like, again, that's so much different than a lot of other companies that I've that I've been a part of and and experienced in this space as well. But what do you feel like sets us apart from other client service relationships?\n\nI'll have to go back to that. Like, I feel like it really is the communication and expectation aspect of it. We tell him one thing as far as probably solves what to expect, but for the most part, we overachieve that. Right?\n\nSo and we do that for a reason because it's a it's a lot worse if you have, like, some kind of numbers in mind, and it just go below that. But if a property is something lower and then you get free, four times a little bit more than that, so so the perfect scenario, give us a specific example, like, you don't have to, maybe if you have a name of a client, but, like, give us an example of a client where it's a memorable interaction and it's just like, man, this is amazing and something that that left like an actual impact on feel like there is a few, but for the most part, it's those that have done some kind of animation services before, and not specifically just fully automated, but some kind of like business they are some industry out there that you basically get coached and you you do the job yourself, right, so expect the results in either one of those areas, those kind of clients that come from that background, they can just see it.\n\nIt's not a day, right, because they're they're so used to the pile of things to work. And then coming, not moving from there to gear, it's just so more seamless. So it's, like, it's a bigger impact. In terms of, like, actual feedback.\n\nRight? We understand how important feedback is, three sixty feedback, us giving, and the feedback on client interactions and getting feedback from actual clients themselves. On things like that. What do you feel like is actually, like, how does ATN do you feel incorporates that feedback into our operation?\n\nRight. So I'm it's very important for that. For the clients to communicate that with us. And I feel like they do that for the most part when they're in an onboarding call with me.\n\nRight? They sound like that middle ground. So when they get on the call, they let us pay that email of what they like on say par or either how hard or simple something could be, and they will make some suggestions on how to make a little bit better. So we do a good job of listening to those feedbacks.\n\nAnd actually implementing it into the platform, whether that's within the onboarding process or a way for them to reach out to somebody or what they have to do on a day to day from their So give me an example. So, for example, that's where the whole sharing the screen will come into play. Right? Because from one particular person, it kind of very difficult to one even join us, right, because talk about somebody that never uses computers.\n\nSo it's good to have patience, with those individuals and get them on the call. Once they're there, then you're able to leave their controller screen with their with their permission, and then actually not do it for them, but walking through a little bit better. Because it's a difference of telling, yo, click on this one here, and they're like, okay, which one? I'm not sure.\n\nAre they gonna get a little frustrated? But if you're managing it and explaining what you're doing as to going slowly, then they get to to understand, like, just not that. One of the things that that I've noticed about you as well, again, is your responsiveness to clients, and you'll actually take calls as late as, like, ten PM your time. And I'm like, I'm already off, chilling with my kids.\n\nLike, I'm not doing anything else, but you're you're grinding away, what, making sure these clients get all the things that they need. How do you manage with the work like balance? Well, I don't do that. A hundred percent of the time.\n\nRight? I do like to say it for the most part, I do, mostly available, but for those times that I'm not, it's just a simple some people are on social media to transfer the phone, so I'm replying to technical feedback. So, but it's not that far to actually be getting trashed back with the client. For that aspect, If I'm not able to attend to that phone call, you just schedule a SIM card.\n\nBut if I am available, I don't mind getting back in the computer and just helping them out and making sure everything's taken care of. A hundred percent. Again, I appreciate that. I know our clients do as well.\n\nSo are there any, like, personal principles that you use or adapt to, like, make sure that you stay on track with your efficiency and any routines that maybe help you with that? Yes. So I do use a tool that one of our staff member created to keep me organized and efficient throughout the whole process. And that's going to be the big impact when it comes to balancing my work and life balance, because I I love the fact that I have, like, no deputies and heaps of that take a lot of my attention away.\n\nSo I wanna make sure that I give them my attention, and then also take care of your clients are at the same time. I love that. Yeah. No.\n\nYou're you're so great with our kids. It's it's so funny that, like, right away, it became it came to my house because this is the first time that you that you come to to my place in Southern California, even though this is somewhere that we're meeting with the team, and then you'll have the summit. So this isn't my actual home, but when you when you landed and you came to my home, you, you met my side. You were spending more time looking at him and talking to him than you were talking to me at first.\n\nSo I was like, wait a second now. I'm the guy. Right? I'm what's happening here?\n\nBut now that you're you're so great with kids. So and I can see why your patience is so amazing. So where do you actually see the future of client support and, you know, success actually for for ATN going forward. I see it growing, though.\n\nAlthough I appreciate the feedback and compliments that I'll get from yourself and the clients, doesn't just take one person to Right? So the future on this is having more individuals appear as much, right, for client success or importantly results as well that are able to add value to what we're currently that's one of the things that, obviously, we're facing in the goal that we do have. It's ultimately to be able to, not only create the seven figure results that we already have, but again, bigger results and ultimately non figure results as well. So being a result oriented to business, the number one focus, but client success client actual of satisfaction is also some that's helpful as well.\n\nIn terms of the aspirations that you personally have to be able to enhance the experience that clients have with us, do you have any of those things in mind? I'm I'm a client myself. Right? I have my own funds invested into some of our platforms.\n\nSo I I get to see some of the things that I feel like can be improved. Those are some things that I bring to the team as well as far as suggestions. Also, some of those comes from the clients themselves. Right?\n\nThings that maybe I didn't notice that they did, and that will help us integrate it into the platform and make it that much better. Right? There's always way to improve. You're actually you've been a a part of this company for years now in terms of being able to take advantage of of the offerings that we've had that you're putting your own capital, can you talk to us about that experience in terms of?\n\nFirst of all, I had no idea that was even possible to to level. There's there's doing things one way that doing it right. Right? So when you open my eyes to this opportunity as far as, like, what we're specifically doing here, it's just taking to another level.\n\nIt's just you seeing let it get your own rips. Right? So with that being said, your profit, right, and you're doing it in a way where you don't have to put too much hands to this, which is the best combination because, like, your time, you get your time back, right, you get a little bit more of what you were expecting, right, and be able to leverage that and help others change your circle advantage of the same stipulate. Hundred percent.\n\nI love that. For our current clients or any future clients as well, do you have anything specific that that you would wanna in part before we get off of here? What I would say is if you're not there yet, just continue to do your research. Right?\n\nWe're not in a position where we're looking to convince anybody of this. This is basically self explanatory, but I would really consider or suggest for you to be doing your research. You would find out what the other side would be, right, and understand, like, why this is, like, to the point where we are hundred percent. And how can clients actually best utilize the support the resources that ATN provides to make sure that they are successful?\n\nJust saying to no. It's okay if you wanted to have things hands off, but the more they talk about what you're investing in, the more doors will open for you. Right? Because you're able to use that.\n\nI mean, not only understand, like, what the platform is doing. But you can only you can also, like, learn from that industry and kinda, like, diversify your support level. No. That makes sense.\n\nSo bonus question, right, off the vineyard here. Why do you believe in I I've known you for a couple years, and you put your money with your mouth. You're not only, like, that kind of person that tried things out, but you try things out. Right?\n\nLike, you invested many different industries I believe you done at Amazon Automation, trucking automation, and they all said the same thing that I've even explained, right, which are promising one thing but under delivering on it. That's really what attracted me to join what you currently joined here. I believe we're seeing the same value in that regards, and I I only see it growing from here. Love it.\n\nCool. Alright. Until next time, people, appreciate your brother."}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"174bd2","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"174bd2","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true}},"options":{}};
