My name is Aaron Richards. I use these networks to make over twenty five thousand a month completely passively. It's how I was able to retire my wife so she could take care of our two kids.\n\nAnd pay for the sky high medical cost for my dad who suffers from Parkinson's. Getting to this point wasn't simple. I've gone through many failures. I've been scammed out of over a hundred thousand dollars by automation guru.\n\nBeen very close to giving up on my search for a passive income vehicle that actually works. I grew up in Cincinnati Ohio, which was a great time apart from the weather, of course. When I was twenty, I moved to Arizona to study for my bachelor's degree psychology where I met my beautiful wife brook. From a young age, my parents always instilled in me the importance of education, hard work, and financial literacy.\n\nBoth my mom and dad have doctorates and work professors, all while also being pillars of our community, only a church as pastors. If I worked hard in college and graduated suma Kunlati, working my whole way through college as customer service representative. After graduating, I started working as a guidance counselor, and at the same time completed my master's degree at Grand Canyon University. I continued to work as a counselor and eventually worked my way up to a figure a year position by the time I turned twenty five.\n\nThis is when me and Brooke got married and moved to Los Angeles. Two years later, her daughter was born. By twenty seven, I was what I call successful on paper. I was living the so called dream.\n\nMe and Brooke were both earning six figures a year. We had a beautiful daughter, and we're renting an apartment in a prime location, Santa Monica, Los Angeles, The reality, however, was very different. LA is expensive, so our salaries didn't go as far as we thought due to high costs and our student loan debts. Not only that.\n\nWe were both working long hours. Brooke was a full time nanny waking up at four thirty AM to work twelve hours a day, and I was trying to climb the corporate ladder. So while we were financially successful, We didn't feel success at all because all our time was going to our jobs, instead of the person that mattered the most at that time, our daughter Brighton. It was around this time I met Raul, a director at the company I worked at, burning well over six figures a year.\n\nI was fortunate to arrange a coffee with him, and we talked about anything in life that we'd regret it. Raul told me his biggest regret was not continuing to invest money. And because of that, he's still stuck in the rat race when he could have escaped if he was making more passive income. This one sentence changed the course of my life because all of a sudden, I knew what I had to do.\n\nI had to start taking investing seriously so I could make enough passive income to at least have Brooke not need to work. I had one problem, though. Had less than thirty thousand dollars in capital, not hundreds of thousands of dollars. So even if I got into something like stocks or real estate, it would take too long to make enough to retire Brook.\n\nI needed more money to be able to This was in twenty twenty when the pandemic happened. The world went into lockdown and suddenly I was allowed to work remotely. But because I no longer needed to travel in person to meet students, my hours went from fifty hours a week, down to ten hours. I now had an opportunity to figure out a way to make additional income and gather more investment capital so I could change my family's life.\n\nAt first, I looked at driving Uber, picking up scooters, quickly realized that wasn't a good trade off for my time. I continued searching and stumbled across an ad talking about becoming a remote salesperson for online businesses. This was right up my alley. I felt I could use my experience in counseling and customer service to learn the skill set quickly.\n\nSo I took the leap of faith and invested in a sales mentorship program. Fast forward a few months, and it turned out I was right. I started making ten k a month on top of my corporate salary. The online business I worked for was an Amazon automation company.\n\nAnd I guess due to the pandemic affecting stocks in real estate, Amazon automation was the big thing that investors were looking for. So I started to think I've been looking for something to invest in and make passive income. I now have the capital saved up, and I wanna put my money where my mouth is, don't wanna sell something. I'm not doing myself.\n\nSo I invested sixty thousand dollars into the same Amazon automation business. I was selling to other investors. At the time, I was excited. Was told because of the pandemic, e commerce was booming, and there was more demand for Amazon than ever.\n\nI thought this was gonna be the thing to help retire Brooke. So she could be a full time mom. The reality, however, was a lot different than I expected. It turned out to be the worst possible investment I could have made with my hard earned capital.\n\nIt took almost seven months for my store to be set which was twice as long as I was told. But worst of all, even after all the waiting, the results were honestly terrible. In my first month of sales on Amazon, I made a total of fourteen dollars and forty and profit. The next month, I made a hundred and twenty six dollars and sixty four cents on a sixty thousand dollar investment, which was nowhere near the returns I was promised.\n\nThe investment I thought was going to retire my wife was making returns that my local credit union can beat. As a husband and a father, I felt frustrated, but also ashamed. Looking back, I'm thankful I have a loving wife in Brook, But at the same time, her love and patience were completely tested. She told me she wasn't angry, and she was grateful for the work I put in to have our family in the financial position we were in by working two jobs but she said next time I needed to find something that I knew one hundred percent was going to work for the majority of people if not everyone.\n\nShe encouraged me and told me to take a step back and see it as a loss for us as a family, but also as a loss for the customers you sold on the same opportunity. This situation put me in a moral dilemma, and I thank my parents who were both passers for teaching me to be the type of person who practices what they preach. So even though my income would lower dramatically, especially because by this point, I had quit my core job. I knew ethically I could no longer continue to sell for that Amazon automation company so I left them.\n\nI was pretty off the idea of e commerce wanted to try something new. I've always been interested in real estate and came across the idea of Airbnb automation, which at the time seemed like a great opportunity because Airbnb was also experience working for the Amazon automation company allowed me to get a role as a sales director for an Airbnb automation company. And just like before, I did the same thing. I invested in the program I was selling, and I invested another forty five thousand dollars thinking lightning couldn't strike twice.\n\nWell, it did. Essentially, the same thing that happened with the Amazon company happened with the Airbnb company. It took forever to see my first payouts, and the payouts were nowhere near what I was told and to make it worse, my Airbnb account ended up getting banned shortly after, and I never got it back. At this point, I was at Rockball I had lost over a hundred thousand dollars to automation gurus, but on top of that, my son Ace had just been born, which meant further financial responsibility as a father.\n\nI realized that this automation world I was in was sleazy. A world where people don't care about their clients or their results. They just try to sell as much as they can of whatever they can to whoever they can. I quickly left the Airbnb automation company because not only did my results suck, But I was also seeing other clients have the same issues.\n\nI I wanted out of this world because it didn't align with my values, my parents taught me, or my background in customer service, which was always about putting the customer Instead, I was seeing people invest a lot of capital expecting a first class experience, but instead not being able to get through to anyone in support. At this point, I had pretty much given up on the idea of making of income and spending more time with my wife and kids. I was going to just go back to my corporate job and follow the traditional path of the rat race. But just like before, at my lowest point, Brook stepped in and encouraged me.\n\nWell, I'm sure most wives would have agreed with my idea to go back to corporate in a life of stability. She told me that if I did that, it would take away time from the kids. Told me she still believed in me, but I just needed to think smarter. I decided I was gonna give this whole passive income thing one last go.\n\nBut thanks to Brooke, I changed my strategy I always believed that my failures weren't because the idea that passive income was a scam. I knew there had to be something out there that worked. My mistake was I kept investing in the business model. I wasn't thinking about investing in the people.\n\nI realized it didn't matter how good the business model was if the people weren't genuine with real proof. So instead of throwing more money at automation scams, I invested in finding better people. I invested in my network through a twenty five thousand a year high level investor mastermind that I'm still a part of today. It's here where I discovered the idea of private trading network.\n\nMet a group of traders in the mastermind who were talking about how they're building out trading algorithms using their experience as traders coupled with machine learning. This caught my attention I've known that people can make a lot of money trading, but I always thought that you'd have to be at a computer all day looking at charts, which was not what I was looking for. The traders told me that used to be the case. But with the recent advancements in machine learning, they've been able to build algorithms that do the training for them, and they just oversee everything to make sure the algorithms are performing.\n\nI was blown away by the idea. So I asked them, more so begged them to let me invest. At first, they told me I wasn't the type of person they were looking for. They were looking for ultra high net worth individuals who have a net worth of at least five million dollars.\n\nNow I thought I was doing well for myself, but my net worth was nowhere near five million dollars, which meant I wasn't qualified to work with these traders, but something told me I just had to find a way to get I focused on building a genuine relationship with them, asking questions and sharing my story and why I was obsessed with making passive income and how I'd lost over a hundred thousand dollars so far trying to retire my wife. After a few months, Eventually, they let me join their network. Now because I had lost so much money already, I did start cautiously. I invested a thousand dollars and tracked how it would do for the first month.\n\nAnd just like they told made around what I expected. I invested more and more capital and eventually built up to a passive income of over twenty five thousand dollars a month, which is what I used to retire Brooke over a year ago. And while we're her was an incredible achievement and honestly the most gratifying achievement in my life so far. I was quickly reminded of what she told me when I lost all that money in the Amazon automation program.\n\nTake a step back. And see it as a loss for us as a family, but also as a loss for the customers you sold on the same opportunity. Oh my goodness. I finally found something that works.\n\nSomething that I'd be proud to promote, and I'm just gonna sit there and not try to help others. No way. My parents raised me better than that. And that's where the idea to start ATM came from.\n\nA community of like minded people who may passive income and grow together as people. It would only work if I could convince the traders to trade the capital of more people like me. In other words, trade for the top ten percent earners instead of only the top one percent. By this time, I had built a good relationship with them.\n\nAnd so after a bit of back and forth, I sold them on the idea of letting me license their service to people I resonated with, real, genuine people who work hard and just wanna do better in life for their family. As part of ATN, my vision was, yeah, about helping people make passive income, but it wasn't about just helping anyone. I wanted it to be an exclusive community of people I myself in, cool people that I could see myself having a drink with. It's why I'm very selective about who I let join and actively reject people who I don't feel like would add to the community"}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"174bd2","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"174bd2","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true}},"options":{}};
