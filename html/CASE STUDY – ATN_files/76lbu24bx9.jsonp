We call this our passive income protocol. Step one, our team will instruct you on how to send your capital to the regulated brokers that we use. Step two, We show you how to get access to our private trading account and take advantage of our proprietary algorithmic trading bot, which is managed and overseen by our private trader.\n\nStep three. Your money has been pooled with other members of the network and you're paid in proportion to the amount of capital you allocate. For example, if ten thousand dollars is allocated and the overall profit is ten percent, Then the gross profit would be ten percent of ten thousand dollars or one thousand dollars before the trader's performance fee. Step four.\n\nYou then receive a deposit into your brokerage account based on the profits generated of course, after the trader has taken their performance fee, which you can then use as passive income or compound back into your trading balance. Now I'm gonna give you a live look on the inside of exactly how this looks and how you can take advantage of truly passive income. Let's do it. Okay.\n\nSo this is a live look inside of one of our active accounts. So as you can see, so this is actually called my FXbook it's a way for us to be able to have a third party, verifier, you know, so that way, you know, everybody is is on the same page and it's transparent in terms of what the actual results are. You see overall there's been a ninety one percent gain on this account. The total balance on the account is just above seven point two million.\n\nTotal profit just above two point four million dollars. You can see the deposits just under eight million withdrawals just under, just above one point five million dollars. So you can see, you know, everybody is able to log into here be able to, as I mentioned, to be transparent and see exactly what's happening, you know, the gains for the month, gains for the week. You guys can actually see all of those things as far as the percentages.\n\nAre concerned. And then you can kind of go over and also take a look at what the, you know, win loss ratio actually is. You can see it's a seventy thirties, just above seventy percent for longs and seventy percent for shorts. So that means that, you know, in terms of all the trades that are, that are gotten into, an average of about seventy or seventy one percent of those trades are actually one.\n\nSo you can also see, you know, one of the things here as well. Just just so you know, this we always and constantly update our trading strategy. The traders are constantly evolving and, you know, you can't rely on the same strategy for, you know, years and years. So they constantly update their strategy.\n\nSo you can see this strategy here started in August. And then right away it started producing exactly what we expected at above fifteen percent, just under fifteen percent, just under seventeen percent, and then a amazing month for the month of December to close out the year at just about twenty two and a half percent. So all of these things are here for you guys to be able to take a look at exactly, not only how transparent this is, but how everything is performing. And so if you're if you're interested in knowing exactly, how all of this works, you know, you're going to be able to hear exactly how it works with our advisor.\n\nYou'll be able to ask ask me the questions that you do have. I will show you a live look at our account as well on that call."}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"174bd2","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"174bd2","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true}},"options":{}};
