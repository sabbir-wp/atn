Like, what what is, maybe some things that you would say to them?\n\nMay, it's where you start. If you wait till tomorrow, you may not start. You need to start today.\n\nSo if I had to tell anybody anything about ATN, I'd say the reason I would go with this company is because the people that's running it, that's behind it, are genuine.\n\nThey're not selling you a drink. They're giving you the realness. Who here kept it real and told me how you're moving around and doing certain things. He said, man, he's still working trying to figure out some other ways to make this better. I said, see, that's what I'm talking about.\n\nWell, I I would be very honest and say that that that in general, I've spent a lot of money on other things that that I've either lost or hasn't produced. And and and I've kind of told this to my sister-in-law. I I said to her that that, that I have frequent calls with you and and we go over things and, you know, you address any concerns I have. And and I and I've also told her that you guys just in general, you you have treated me very well oh, that's huge. That that's rare that you see that kind of generosity from from really anyone, you know, especially a company this. I don't think I'd ever encounter any other company that stepped up to the plate for the customer. So so I would just say you you really need to give them a try because they are legitimate.\n\nSo it's like anything in life. You don't have all the answers, but if it feels right, then the timing is right, take that jump that that leap of faith for me, it's always gonna feel that jump, that initial jump is always gonna feel scary. But when you have other people that have done it and said, hey, listen, it's gonna be okay. It's a lot easier.\n\nHaving heard testimonials from Cheryl and some of the other guys, I don't know their names, but that helped me a lot. And I hope that I know this helps somebody out there, but, but I'm a real person. I don't work for AT in the same vein. If this continues to do what it's doing, it literally is.\n\nFor me, I feel good about it. Those take a bite.\n\nSo here's the first thing that I would say is that for anybody who's been burned on something, I'm gonna be willing to bet that there were a couple of things that were in common on what they got burned. Versus they had to pay it pretty sizable fee upfront. And if they had any additional investments for inventory or whatever, they never got a chance to where they could physically verify or monitor those assets. So that's a huge difference here.\n\nYes. There is a fee up front to be part of this network, but anything that you invest as far as your capital, it is in your brokerage account in your name, you see it all the time. So if you don't like how things are going after a week or two, pull it out. You can't do that with any other opportunity.\n\nNow, yes, obviously, your fee has invested. Your fee sunk, but there's always a risk to play on any opportunity. And if you're if you're on the on the fence, nobody's gonna sit here and be like, oh, there's no risk involved. Of course there's risk involved.\n\nBut this one's panned out better than any of the rest of them.\n\nTry it. You you have to try it. If you don't try, you you'll you'll never know. I am proofs and silly this year, and I'm part of it.\n\nAnd this is better than working. This is better than working for someone or, you know, being in that rat race, this is better than an income. In my opinion, it's like it's like a worker bee that is doing stuff for you. And you don't have to do anything.\n\nAnd like I said, it's a godsend. I'm grateful. You have to try it. I say go for it.\n\nThere's no guarantee, but it's been guaranteed. And this is better than any other passive form that I've I've I've seen thus far, better than any other investment because it's actually paying and you're living but from my experience.\n\nSo Especially right now, the, you know, the economy is not doing well.\n\nAnd a lot of people having struggle, especially in income, if they did this program really do the what they have to do in the program is really gonna help them.\n\nI believe it should take a chance of this one. I know there's so many scammers or the, sort of, I don't say fake, but the to some program, many programs may not work so easily, as they promised ATN, the program of business that, gives a passive income and, as it was promised or maybe more promised return that, what we're getting. So, which is fantastic. Try this. Yeah.\n\nWell, I'd have to say anybody that gets involved in something like this has got to be willing to take it a chance. All this is, and if you're willing to take a chance, I think, in the long run, you and I, we all agree with you.\n\nHonestly, man, If it ain't no risk, it really ain't have no reward behind it. Because if you scam late on make not, you gotta be all in with this or do like most people If you're gonna put it on the market, if you're gonna invest it, make sure it's something that you're not gonna miss when you put it up.\n\nYeah. I would say it's a very, very good option. Very good option. We'll take action.\n\nBest thing about the program, at least how I had experienced it thus far as you have the opportunity to earn your money back relatively quickly. You could take that money out, and then you can then you can start playing with house money. There's no no reward without the risk. I think this is definitely worth the risk.\n\nSo think you definitely get the shot.\n\nSo, you know, you have the skepticism of it's too good to be true. I did my research. I test drove this. I've been test driving it just in my accounts alone. It it truly is. It it truly is is wondering.\n\nJust do it. Just send it and forget it. Just do it. That's it. Nothing. Yeah.\n\nJust do it like Nike. That's fine. Just set it and forget it. That's it.\n\nI just had that gut feeling with you that you were you were going to go to the end to to make sure you you didn't want people to have that feeling you had of a hundred grand loss and nowhere to go. So I just had the gut feelings. Why I chose to do this?\n\nI would say just do it to earn money on the first day.\n\nI'm not gonna say everybody would earn money on a first day, but the way it looks, everybody would earn a little something on the first day if it's set up correctly.\n\nSure.\n\nJust to do that, you don't find opportunities like this. It's it's fantastic. It's gonna come to earn money on that first day, that first week. And, actually, we were while we were sleep How much you owe?\n\nYou can't earn money wisely. What is your money doing now? Like, why are you looking at this video? You're looking for something more.\n\nTrust your loyalty. It takes money to make money. Number one, but I think a lot of people don't realize that. So that's that's the way it was with us, and we trust over the world.\n\nWe land in a spot. We land in a great spot. With with you and your company, we're going forward. So I I would say just to everybody, hey, if you're on the fence, I I hook yourself from the fence, go right through the fence, keep it moving.\n\nThis is the opportunity.\n\nSo with anything new, I was nervous. But again, in in anything that you're gonna venture into, you you almost have to do your research and and understand to a certain degree what you're walking into.\n\nI was skeptical and a little nervous too, but what sold me was I sent the joint to start my investment. I, wired fifty thousand dollars. Okay.\n\nBut it was from the wrong account because my aux account is a personal Yeah.\n\nAnd if fifty thousand came from a this business account.\n\nYeah.\n\nAnd and what made what sold me, but you guys wasn't legit when you sent fifty thousand dollar back.\n\nI was way skeptical, and I've been burned before, like I said, by other passive income things, and then I've been scammed, scammed out of money online too. It was criped. So I was I was reading, reading nervous. But, I just took the leave of faith that Wait.\n\nWell, I mean, everybody's skeptical. And I pulled this to Henry. So you're telling me x, y, and z. Yeah.\n\nOkay. What what's the catch? It's like a young catfish or somebody. It it's one of those deals that it is that's gonna be true.\n\nSince this affiliate marketing wasn't working out. Most stocks were more work and things like that. I was a little skeptical at first. And I but then I thought, you know what?\n\nIt's just worth finding out more information. Right? So that's when I did whatever I did to contact you guys. Like, I'm doing some research to just thought that this you guys were worth the shot.\n\nDefinitely nervous and and skeptical just because, you know, there's so many different things out there. I've been scanned in a few different things over my lifetime from from people that I know. So when you're investing in things with people you don't know, I think the odds or the chances are that much greater, right?\n\nI wouldn't say skeptical because when I usually am skeptical, I don't really go through feel like, nah, I'm gonna I feel like this is the thing. I'll do it.\n\nNow, even if I fail at the thing, at least I like firming my decision, I I stand on Yeah.\n\nSo after that, a first initial consultation call, I was like, okay. I was like, this is this could be it right"}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"174bd2","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"174bd2","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true}},"options":{}};
