Aaron Richard's here. We are back and still here with my mom. This is part two.\n\nSo on this one, we're gonna actually go into more details of passive income specifically, how it's impacted our lives and why exactly it's important to make sure that you are focused on passive income and not just pushing it off and feeling like, oh, you know, I'm gonna be able to just save my way to retirement, and it's all gonna be great. So one of the things that we talked about in the, previous conversation that we did have was about, how I grew up and why I am who I am today. My mom was a big influence on that and also the family dynamic that we had But we'll talk about how her life has been impacted by my dad's illness and exactly how that's affected myself, but also our finances and then what specifically she's doing now and how that's helping her circumstances today through the use of ATN and and the help there.\n\nSo you might hear a voice in the background. You will hear a voice in the background. And it's from Joseph, who is somebody that you guys have probably no doubt have been seen before. But he's gonna be asking some of the questions to us.\n\nAnd we flew him out down here that's what I do for my team. It's really important to make sure that everybody experiences what it is that we have going on down here in Medogene. So without further ado, let's go ahead and get this started.\n\nWhat was your idea of retirement. And what was your actual plan towards that?\n\nSo I've, grew up kinda traditional, as I said, in the video, I started off being an engineer, I saved. I had a beautiful four zero one, k account, then kind of, like, ten years later, I went to work at a college. We have special state teachers retirement, that matched the portion of our income. And then at the time, my husband was working and had retirement and everything.\n\nSo we were very disciplined people, live within our means, just went to work and was just looking for that retirement. And then, unfortunately, my husband was diagnosed with a chronic illness of, Parkinson's disease. Had to retire early. I always thought that I was gonna retire at age fifty five coming up on age sixty two in a week or so and still having to work because, I had active income, five streams of active income, but as my husband's illness progressed, I had to stop working some of those streams.\n\nSo if I would have had an opportunity to invest and be part of something like ATN, I would probably be retired by now, even though I'm getting closer than what I was before, and I'll talk to you about that what my son has offered to me and his dad.\n\nAnd can you share with us the early days of when it started to happen and once you started to realize, oh, I need to start looking for alternative investments, or maybe I need to work some more hours.\n\nLike So in my forties, when we were raising the children, kind of in the forties, they were going off to college.\n\nSo we had three that were pretty close in same age just a few years apart. And so I would work I would do extra working as a adjunct instructor for the college that I worked for. I am an author. So I have written a book and I would do public speaking and then also, selling the book that I've self published.\n\nAnd there's doing some other consulting types of work, but as I stated, and those were really good income streams. But as the illness of my husband progressed, then I had to I couldn't go travel as much. To speak. I couldn't, teach the extra classes because he needed my time or attention or I needed to be coordinating efforts between his nurses and doctor's appointments and things like that.\n\nDid you have any in cleaning in clinics that this could ever happen?\n\nNever thought it. My husband was slim. Was very fit, was on, no medication and then went to from, like, zero to, like, fifty pills a day. We never thought that this would ever have happened to us.\n\nAnd then when it start happening, did you have to tap into your like, savings and retirements.\n\nWe didn't have to tap into the savings and retirement in the beginning, because as I, stated in the other video, that he was offered a wonderful severance packet. So we didn't have to tap into to savings at that time, but what we did have to tap into was alternative, lifestyles in a different country, for medical care that was way more affordable than what it costs to be in the United States.\n\nWhat was the cost in the US?\n\nSo in the US, even for today, right now, his medical care will be eighteen thousand dollars a month, eighteen thousand in the US for what he's getting here in Columbia. Right now, we are currently paying six thousand dollars a month, and we're actually getting lower care. So he has a twenty four hour care And then he has, a cook. He's in a private home. He gets a little bit more care for a third of the cost.\n\nAnd did you know about these expenses?\n\nAbsolutely. Right. We we're a family that talks about money, you know, pretty openly. And I knew how much it was. I was like, that's ridiculous.\n\nSo Did you also have to sacrifice time with your five income streams when the illness, like, started to having the early days.\n\nLike, they Absolutely.\n\nI had to begin to shut down stream one, stream two, stream three, because I just didn't have the time or the energy to do it. And then I travel So we've been here eight years, but every two months, I travel here to be with my husband for a week to two weeks at a time.\n\nSo before discovering AT and A, Right? You were in a difficult situation. What was life back then for you guys, right, before ATN? And how do you think things would be differently if ATN had been available? Ten years ago.\n\nWell, so when my husband received the severance package, if ATN would have been available, I would immediately invest it huge portion of the funds into ATM.\n\nWell, so that type of opportunity was not available. It's not available. To the public like that. Right?\n\nSo we have the opportunity to again offer this, but and it's just because of the relationships that I've been able to create fortunately of being in the right opportunities, the right place, and being persistent. But, ultimately, what happened was, who prioritized making sure that you had the cash liquid and wanted to make sure that you were able to pay for his expenses and have no real need for, like, for having to fill out paperwork in order to use the money or have check with a money manager in order to get the money out or whatever it was. So you prioritize that when in hindsight, we would have definitely better than better served to have assets and have cash flowing assets more importantly.\n\nBut, of course, you know, at that time, you did exactly what you felt was right and you I don't feel like you too much regrets.\n\nI don't have any regrets. Not not not not any.\n\nWhat was the emotional to a hundred person like?\n\nSo what has happened since it's a chronic illness and been for twenty years.\n\nWhat has happened is that my health began to deteriorate because of the stress because of the, man of his health care because of even the travel coming back and forth to Columbia every two months. Now some people might say you're fortunate to be able to travel like that, but It's people that's in America right now that's just the day to day of taking care of someone from being that caregiver. It is extremely, stressful.\n\nI, myself, personally, I was diagnosed with cancer two years ago and was able to get the proper health care here in this country in thirty days was able to get it How long was it gonna take in the US?\n\nOh my god. Six months to even get in to see I I called to get a second opinion on this, and they were, like, six months. And I'm telling you in thirty days, they had removed the cancer and had me scheduled for the radiation.\n\nMy son's paid for the radiation, and it's just having that passive income and being able to, set priorities and redirect things. Who would have ever thought that I would have been sick like that? But, we were able to respond to it in cash, unless we pay for even the cancer removal in cash, And then, my insurance reimbursed me, but we weren't playing with it. We needed the cash, pay for it in cash, and then I went to Aaron and his brother, to pay for the radiation treatment. And they pay cash for it. It's I mean, I've been cancer free now for two years.\n\nBut this is something that we also do wanna talk about. Right? Cause there's this idea of the perfect retirement, twenty years Roth IRA, four zero one k, sixty. No. When I'm in the sixty, I'm able to pull it out. With no penalties, things of that nature.\n\nHowever, based on your life experience, do you think it's a smart idea to just follow that traditional Absolutely not.\n\nAnd that was since the five active income streams, you never want to have all the eggs in the one bath it. You want to be able to have multiple streams. And the more that you can have the type of string where that you don't have to be active, then that is going to be more beneficial to you can then concentrate on things that are more important to yourself. To your lifestyle or to your health, doing things that you wanna do. It could be reading. It could be walking. It could be just relaxing.\n\nBut what did the Social Security Oh my god.\n\nWhat did they tell you? Trigger? What did they tell you?\n\nSo I worked ten years in corporate America.\n\nAnd I was guaranteed that you're gonna get x amount of money when you turn, retirement age. So and this is coming to me all in my twenties, all in my thirties, all in my florities. And then, bam, they start slowing it down a little bit. So I go into social security office probably, like, three years ago.\n\nAnd I say, hey, I'm thinking about retiring in the next three to five years. Just wanna know where I'm gonna be, how I'm gonna be sitting because you used to say I was gonna get this amount. And they said, ma'am, Tell me how much you make right now. And I tell them, and they say, you're going to get fifty percent.\n\nAnd I was like, but I already paid ten years into the program. This is you're gonna get fifty percent. So I went even for some reason, I'm a glutton for punishment. But I went even six months ago.\n\nAnd I said, hey, I'm gonna retire next year. How much are you gonna give me? They said how much is pension gonna be? I told them they said, not gonna get a nickel.\n\nNot zero.\n\nNot a From a hundred percent to fifty percent.\n\nFifty percent. Fifty percent. I don't really it's, like, whatever.\n\nBut then you're So my husband is living off a pension off of Social Security right now.\n\nI think that's a decent, Social Security check. I said, so as a surviving spouse when he transitions, what are you going to give me? Hey, sad.\n\nI was like, y'all, no. This is criminal.\n\nIt is criminal what you're doing. I'm gonna call fifty people out now and let them know that this is what you guys are doing. So he's getting a check right now. We use it for his health care, his expenses, but the day he dies, it cuts off and you better not cash that check if you get one because they'll try to put you in jail.\n\nIt is whack. We're not talking about the Social Security administration. A lot. If you think you're gonna retire and get a good Social Security check.\n\nThat is questionable. You need to go in and talk to them now because they are reducing it every two dollars that you make, every one dollar you make, they take two dollars away from you. So I was getting a very nice four digit check that I was supposed to be guaranteed when I retire, and it is it went from four digits to three digits down to zero. Zero.\n\nSo this is why I was so adamant about four zero one k's. I was like, so me, like, you guys can see, like, a a lot of this stuff that I'm doing now has to do with, like, what I've seen. Like, I prayed for wisdom when I was younger. Right? Because knowledge comes from, study, right, knowledge comes from, like, experiences, but wisdom comes from, like, other people's experiences and learning from those. And then also applied knowledge, right, applying what you learn. So for me to see her social security experience and me kind of going through the four zero one k, I was like, first of all, in thirty, forty years while I'm supposed to retire, they could create a policy and be like, yeah, you know, because we're going to war, or because we're doing this, we're gonna actually revalidate those funds.\n\nAaron, that's a great point. You have to watch. Because every couple years, they change the policy on you, the Congress, the legislation, they change the policy. So you can start off one way But if you're not on top of it, you'll be like me. Get zero.\n\nThe goalpost constantly moves. And that's one of the things that I was keenly aware of, like, when I was still in the corporate world, I was just like, look, like, if they're gonna play this game, then I gotta play the wealth game because I know that there people outside of this rat race. There's people outside of the four zero one k dependency, social security dependency. Like imagine all Like, think of the wealthiest person that right? And think about how often they will talk to you about their Social Security check. Think about how often they talk to you about depending on government assistance.\n\nRight? Really traditionally the wealthiest people that I know are anti government assistance or anti government involvement because they're just like don't try to mess with my money. I just made this money or I like it. So that's what I've always known.\n\nWhen I hear certain people talk about the reliance on their four zero one k or they're just that's their only option. Right? So you're not gonna you don't wanna leave free money on the table. So if you're in a corporate job, of course, if they have a match, hundred percent.\n\nYes.\n\nGet that match. Pre tax dollars or whatever. Like, get the match. But don't well, this is just my opinion.\n\nI wouldn't contribute past the match. And you should not. And you pay and you pay attention to what's happening with the four zero one. K?\n\nIs it performing? Okay. Is it performing to a standard that you're comfortable with? If it's not, is there a better is there a way to reevaluate that capital?\n\nRight? Let's say you have a hundred thousand dollars in that four zero one k account, but you've got a fifty thousand dollar student loan you got a thirty thousand dollar car payment, and you got twenty thousand dollars worth of, I don't know, personal consumer debt that you're just like, ah, like, I really need to get rid of this. Right? You could consider taking a percentage of that out in order to pay for that education, right, to pay for that past education.\n\nLike, that's what I did. I took out my four zero one k, I've got, like, probably in the four figures or whatever left in my four zero one k because I use a good amount of it to be able to make sure that, like, as I'm paying off things, I'm able to do it, like, faster. Right?\n\nAnd you have more available cash to you.\n\nExactly. So it only took me a couple of years to get myself out of consumer debt. Because I led what I knew that I couldn't really rely on thirty, forty years from from then. And then I also knew that I wasn't gonna continue on the corporate path.\n\nSo I was like, well, this little, like, fifty thousand dollar l four zero one k, and thirty forty years is gonna be a few hundred thousand dollars, but, like, I knew that, like, equity would take care of that. I knew that my business revenue would take care of that. I knew that income would eventually be able to take care of that. So that's what made me make that adjustment.\n\nIs it wise for someone to continue the traditional path or actually start entertaining other investment vehicles.\n\nIt's definitely wise for the person to entertain other vehicles. You just wanna do that period. Keep your traditional path. That's the point. And then you want to add. That's the point. You want to add and you want to be to make it as automated as possible so that you could be doing other things, especially enjoying your life.\n\nIt's not a it's not an either or.\n\nIt's it's a both hand.\n\nRight? Yes. It's definitely something that, like, for me in my position, I'm never gonna put myself in business. Like, don't do that.\n\nNever do that. That's not what you should ever do. Well, did you consider? And this is my counseling background.\n\nWell, did you consider this opportunity as well? Or did you, like, what about this for you in addition to that? Or well, tell me, like, in your eyes, How is that benefiting you right now and what will kind of happen in the future? Just kind of giving a chance to, like, really have them really think about where they're at.\n\nIf you're in a position where you're solely reliant and you only have that for retirement, then you would probably do well to consider the other opportunities that are out there to of course, diversify.\n\nSo, of course, also have increase, right, because one plus one is two. Right? But if you only have just the one thing, now you're just reliant. You're solely reliant. You're almost desperate, right, for that to continue to be successful.\n\nAnd, Erin, one thing that we've been doing as a family So when I actually do retire, I'm going to have more income than when I was working.\n\nYes. It's all documented. I'll I'll have more income than when I was working, but the problem that our family had is what about dad. So that's where ATN has come in to help to bring that me working every day, forty hours a week right now, when I actually retire, I will have more money, not working.\n\nWell, let's talk about that. Right? Cause there's a big reason why you are still working Right? And it's because you're not working forty hours a week.\n\nWell, hi. Let's call it guys call it later. I am a tenured faculty member of a college. And I'm not required to work forty hours a week.\n\nRight. So you're paid off of four. You're salaried off of a forty hour work week. But to be honest, right, is it anywhere between ten and twenty hours a week traditionally?\n\nIs it okay.\n\nSo for okay.\n\nYou know what? So let's just say, right?\n\nSo for me, I'm saying, well, I don't really, like, I recorded or not.\n\nRight? GC shout out lopes up. Maybe, you know, I, you know, during the pandemic, especially, during a pandemic especially house working ten or fifteen hours a week, but, of course, you still have to perform. You still have to earn your paycheck based off of the metrics that you're supposed to hit.\n\nBut I was able to work less and still earn the same amount. And that was a big reason why I was like, man, I've gotta figure out another stream. I've gotta have more streams because I'm not working forty plus hours a week. So for you, that's the only reason why you're still working.\n\nIf you were actually working forty hours a week slaving that at your desk like a a horse getting whipped, Right? Then would you be retired right now, especially based off of what I told you a couple years ago? Would you still be working?\n\nRight. I'll be glad Our Chapman can have to work one day a week.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo let's be real.\n\nRight?\n\nLike, we're here to be real about the reality of what's happening here. You've been here for about six weeks.\n\nI ain't seen you take no call. Listen. Alright. Hey. Listen. Right.\n\nIt's You're spilling the tea. What are you feeling the tea?\n\nWe're just here to be real. Right? Everybody appreciates authenticity.\n\nThis is gonna get the forty million y'all. Forty million likes.\n\nAt the end of the day.\n\nRight. You know, we we want people to just understand. It's not a oh, ATN is gonna be a lifesaver and a life changer, and it's we're gonna be able to, like, ride on like a a white cape and make sure to save the day. No. But what it is going to be an opportunity for you to be able to diversify for you to be able to have multiple streams And I ideally, a passive income stream like we provide to where you can set that aside or be able to, like, kind of have that be in the background while you're still doing the things that you need to do on a daily basis to make sure that your immediate needs are taken care of. And then you're essentially, leveraging the fact that it's passive to be able to just be earning and boosting your retirement, boosting your, your current savings in order for you to be able to do the things that you really wanna do and live life on your own terms.\n\nAbsolutely. That's what passive income is all about.\n\nYep. And I tell her all the time, right, in terms of, like, because she kind of is, like, in between myself as far as being a pretty aggressive investor, so to speak, or somebody who is a bit of taker. Right? Somebody who's who's okay.\n\nMy risk tolerance is higher than hers. Right? And that has to do with age, that has to do with my, just, my circumstances, right, earlier in my career. Right?\n\nAnd I can take some swings that maybe a sixty plus year old is not willing or able to take. But one of the things that I, like, strive for, and I always, like, wanna make sure that she knows for herself is it's like, we don't just wanna have, like, an okay or even a really good a really good life can have chilling doing good. Oh, everything's okay. Right?\n\nNot much to worry about financially, not worry much to worry about, you know, professionally. But I'm someone who strives for greatness. I'm someone who strives for excellence, being my best self at all times. Right?\n\nThat means, like, why don't you have enough money in order to be able to go on a yacht in the south of France. Right? Why don't you have enough money in order to be able to put a a nephew or a niece through college, not just your own it. Right?\n\nWhy not have enough capital to be able to really make an impact on villages in Africa or in your own community? Right? Some people are focused on their own retirement, which is great. But when you have a vision that's bigger than just yourself, that's bigger than just your immediate set of circumstances, then that's gonna pull you to a level.\n\nIt's gonna basically make you rise to a certain level. And and now for me being in a position that I'm in now to where I can support my family in that way. I told her a couple of years ago, I want to I'm intentional in wanting to be able to help. Not just the fact that it's hard enough living in Southern California with a full family, and of being only able to take care of myself in a suburban neighborhood.\n\nGreat. Wonderful. Well, but if I'm just able to do that, then what position is that leading you guys in?\n\nExactly. I'll have another section.\n\nThe thing I I think I wanna also talk about is the automated network portion. So what does that mean view area as far as the network portion.\n\nYeah.\n\nSo, I mean, your network, your community, you're only as strong as, like, the members of that community. Right? And that's why we're really specific and we really pay attention. I'm critical on who actually is a part of the network.\n\nIt's because if we just have people that don't really have strong minds. They're not really focused on or interested in their future and living their best lives. They're not really interested in, like, kind of being non traditional and having the having more than the average, those aren't the people that I really wanna be around so much because I strive for greatness. Right?\n\nIt it you're not you the one worst enemy of greatness is mediocrity. I don't want anybody in my network to be mediocre. I want them to at the very least strive to be their best self. The community aspect is just like each individual has a strong background, a strong level of expertise that could help the next person in the community.\n\nRight? We've got real estate professionals, Right? We've got people that are in, oh, business development. We've got people that are in mergers and acquisitions, and that, these real estate developers can connect with somebody who's in mergers and acquisition use some of that capital and create something amazing.\n\nRight? And we've seen these connections happen. So that's one of the things that I've been really a part of making sure that my executive team just as always aware of increasing the quality of clients that we have so that everybody has the opportunity to not only benefit from, but what we can help with on the in, which is passive income, but what can we also help it with in the back end, which is connecting people with other like minded individuals and people that are going to ultimately be able to really help them and get them to that level that they really wanna be at.\n\nDo you accept everything?\n\nOf course. Right. I mean, because a lot of people are mediocre for don't really strive to be passed than what's normal, what's traditional, and that's traditionally people are in the rat race. Right?\n\nTraditionally, people aren't earning passive income and not in a position to where they can retire early or retire on their own terms and they'll be able to to live life on their own terms. So now we don't accept everybody. So we have a a ton of calls every single week, every single month. And more often than not, they don't have the opportunity to, oh, get personally interviewed by me and figure out if it's a really good fit.\n\nOur advisors are trained and equipped to be able to know, okay, what specifically are we looking for? What quality of prospect are we actually looking for? Who's ideal? Right?\n\nWe pay very close attention to who is the ideal client prospect. And then, so the ones that get through the advisors and feels a good fit for them, then I'll come on. Have a conversation. Make sure that everything is aligned as far as expectations, as far as the goals that they have for themselves and what we can actually help them to provide.\n\nSo if it's not aligned, I'll kind of give my advice. It's really my but she mentioned in the other video that I'm living in my purpose, I'm kind of flowing in the work that I was called to do, which is to counsel and to be able to help people is to really understand and listen to where the person actually is. And if it's genuinely a good fit for them, that's what I'm gonna recommend. Right?\n\nI'm gonna give the stamp of approval. We're gonna move forward. But if it's genuinely not a good fit, right, you're pulling from your four zero one k, and that's the only source of capital that you have. I don't wanna have that happen for you.\n\nRight? I I don't want you to I I don't want it to be something that's an all or nothing. Right? I don't want you to be taking money off of your off of your mortgage or or risk risking your mortgage, risking your food, on the table for your family.\n\nThat's not how this is. Right? This is meant for people that are six figure earners or seven figure earners that have experience either automation burn realizing that they're trying to get passive income and they weren't somewhat, like, they weren't with the right team that could actually perform. These are for people that are in the stock market that are seeing the traditional seven to ten percent returns on a yearly basis.\n\nAnd it is for people that are in a real estate as well that are seeing that around ten percent annual return, and it's and it costs so much in order to acquire the properties, especially now. The interest rates are ridiculous. The housing market a bubble right now. It's not even a great time to get into real estate at this time, in my opinion.\n\nRight? So that's for that's, oh, who this community is for. And who this community is not for are those that are not like minded, don't wanna strive for greatness, don't wanna see what's next and see what's possible as far as earning passive income and being in a position to travel and live life on their own terms. So with that, you know, you know, as everybody understands how to be able to find us, you can click the link in the description to be able to know more about if ATN is the right opportunity for you.\n\nIf you're specifically looking for passive income, that can work in tandem with the other things that you have going on and really wanna strive to be, in an excellent position and live wherever you want in the world and travel however you want to. So with that being said, I appreciate you guys watching. Thanks, mom, for being a part of this. And maybe we'll do another one, but you may not see her again.\n\nSo Oh, she wants to be seen now. She gonna be seen now. Alright. So we'll see you on the next"}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"174bd2","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"174bd2","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true}},"options":{}};
