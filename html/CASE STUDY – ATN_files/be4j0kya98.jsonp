Okay. Because this is the only thing I got that's making any money because everything else was falling short.\n\nI would reckon number one from what the passive income Yeah. Definitely number one. I've only done a few truly passive income, but, yeah, those haven't panned out at all. So, yeah, it'll be up there for sure.\n\nNot even a question. This is the most transparent, the best one. The one that you really get I mean, you can really trust. I mean, I don't even think it's a question what the other ones are. We've all been through. I think everybody who gets to this point has been through all the things that we've all been through already. We all have this story.\n\nNo. No. No. I I don't have nothing. I don't have nothing else I'm doing right now besides what I'm bringing in. Yeah.\n\nThe fact that I'm even making money next or the following week says a lot about what y'all able to do.\n\nYeah. Right now, it's tops. Right?\n\nYeah. No. I definitely rank it towards the top. Because like I said, it's it's more of a true, passive model than the others. Even though, yes, they will run it for you and all those kinds of things, but there's still some work on the front end as well as, some potential work you have to kind of do throughout the the middle of it. So when you think about the term passive, I would say it's at the top of the truly passive list.\n\nOh, number one. Mean, I've only I'm not it's only been Amazon, Shopify, and ATN.\n\nATN. Absolutely.\n\nThe other two have lost money. So Yeah. Also, no brainer.\n\nNumber one, because your returns are much faster. It you know, the the the returns with, well, with with the the Facebook store and and with my Amazon store, they're they're quite small. I mean, it takes it just takes a long time to scale those stores so that you have a lot more income coming in. So So if I were if I were to rate everything that I'm doing right now, you guys would be number one without question.\n\nNumber one.\n\nNumber one, only because it's automated. It's like in your your doing I don't have to think about it. It just is fun. And like, doing anything, you know, not saying that I'm not asking questions, but I like the fact that I can just set it and forget it.\n\nSo I I would actually break it number one because it's literally the the easiest all I did was just press a couple buttons on my iPad I just invested the money from my bank account and, and now the money is working. So I I think it's actually, you know, really passive versus you know, other ones felt more like a job, but it's it's really money that's increasing while you sleep.\n\nATN, well, number one because this is my first time I'm doing a passive income opportunity and yes it is the best. I mean, I tried other like, again, I I tried other forms of, e commerce or, automation or other business strategies, and that took a lot of work for passive, you know, technically a passive automated self, you know, automated management approach. This is this is like a game changer or or it's it's like it's a no brainer. You you just sit around and it's paying at the end of the month. And, yeah, I'm excited as long as they have savings, why not? I mean, I mean, I don't wanna say why not, just go for it, you know, but definitely I I highly recommend it. It's it's number one.\n\nI would say I would rank you pretty high.\n\nOh, it's definitely number one for me right now.\n\nAnd If you look up the definition of ATN, it it does equal passive.\n\nSo One of the most transparent, you you you guys deliver what you guys there is no, well, I told you that this or I said this.\n\nIt it is one of those matters, Erin, that. You guys say this is what we can do for you, and this is what you deliver.\n\nHundred and ten percent. Because, I never really received any passive income from the others.\n\nBelieve it or not, I have this pretty much run on autopilot for you. It gives you huge sense of, like, security, not just financially but just mentally. It's running on autopilot. All you have to do checking.\n\nAnd if you feel like, hey, it's not growing enough, you can either, hey, is there a higher count? Is can I throw in more money? And pretty much I've asked those questions. You guys It's pretty much a little bit more of your control of how how, how much you want it to grow, how, and the speed of how you like it to grow.\n\nSo to me, that's awesome."}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"174bd2","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"174bd2","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true}},"options":{}};
