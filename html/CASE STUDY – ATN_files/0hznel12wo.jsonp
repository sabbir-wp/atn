I mean, every other automation company automation company out there needs babysitting. You still have to manage the partner that's going on. This one, there were several days where I would eleven o'clock Pacific.\n\nI look at it, go to bed, wake up, boom. Stuff happened. It literally made money while I slept. So, okay, that's different.\n\nI don't have to check up on it to make sure that it's doing something productive.\n\nI just have to watch it to make sure it's performing You and Julio, man.\n\nJust down to Earth. He listens. You know, he wasn't trying to get me to move and coerce me a direction. He didn't do nothing needed to the guy who signed me up.\n\nBut if I had to tell anybody anything about ATN, I'd say, the reason I would go with this company is because the people that's running it, that's behind it, are genuine. They're not selling you a dream. They give you the realness. And when he told me how you were who he all kept the real and told me how you're moving around and doing certain things, you're still working your ass off.\n\nThat's a fact. You're still working your ass off. You ain't chilling with the money? Absolutely.\n\nI I when I heard that, I said, see. I saw he ain't just in on the bahamas sitting on the beach. He said, hell no. Said, may still work and try to figure out some other ways to make this better?\n\nAnd I said, see, that's what I'm talking about. Yeah.\n\nThis one is hands off, and it's just when you're sleeping, you're not doing anything that kind of passive approach It's just been sustainable. Yeah. The greatest thing about the going with you and a lot of, you know, the the ventures that we've been in is it's consistent and I like that. It, you know, I don't have to lift a finger and it's doing it when it's, you know, it's doing great, doing good things for me.\n\nSo appreciate is these kinds of calls where you offer your court, and and you basically show your transparency. You know, shady companies don't do this. It's just true. You you don't ever get this kind of transparency and communication really with with the shady company. That has been so good to me to see these frequent communication, just to give me more peace of mind that that, you know, my money is in a good place. That's that's been huge for me.\n\nHassle free. First of all, and daydreaming, you have to sit there see the charts and this and that, then you have to do, like, buy now sell now. This that this everything is automated. You just put in your money, you're good to go. You just set it, forget it. You can come back later once a week. Prosper the funds in your account to pound it over there.\n\nIt's it's the set and forget aspect of like this is truly you shut it up. Like you said, you let it go with with the networks. They they they do it. You set up the strategies and they do it.\n\nI I just gotta say that that sets this that sets this apart from other opportunities that I've seen anyway. I just know that I love this opportunity and I seek profits and I see where it's passive. But it starts with you, Erin, may I like I said, I could tell you were a family guy right off the bat, but not right there. Number one, that they really got me.\n\nThat's I I said, I know this is an honest opportunity with an on Skye to helm So but that did it for us. I love it.\n\nWell, just a tangible cash flow, passive income in such a short period of time has been obviously very beneficial as a bunch of articulated laid out, but I think opening my mind to the the possibility and the vehicles that exist and the methods that exist to back and develop large, large streams of passive income without the traditional hemes, right, from a clean, active, velocity to to get that much passive income had to be consistent.\n\nAnd then we're we're vetting them and making sure they're secure and safe and not gonna go away, you know, the next day, then having all of that is really, really a great thing, and it'll do a whole lot of different things.\n\nSo What what do you feel like actually makes ATN different?\n\nThe personal ability, the one zero one, that's that's what really got me because if you had to go tell folks that one zero one would be able to just pull it out. But the one zero one that he walked me through, and he's very personable. I loved it. I loved that about eighteen years.\n\nEspecially, you know, with the customer or I sent a email, customer support, answered all my questions, and then you were gracious enough to answer my questions, you know, over text or phone, resume know, I'm I'm I'm definitely pleased with the, customer support. The my issue I had with a lot of these companies, you you you can invest a lot of money. Best, you'll get an email We can't even talk to a live person. And so when I had something similar with crypto, I was so confused.\n\nI got stuck where I couldn't even invest. Because I didn't know how to navigate the app for crypto. I couldn't even talk to anyone on the phone. Yeah.\n\nAnd so here, I have someone that walked me through, you know, you would get the screen sharing and you were able to walk me through the the process to make sure, you know, everything went smooth and that I was making money.\n\nIt's those little things.\n\nIt's those little things, really.\n\nYou know? It's those little things. I mean, I I I've tried a couple of things like I said before. This is my first time talking to the owner of the company that I've been trying things with.\n\nThe fact that you guys seem to be more down the earth, not high pressure salesman, and I feel like I'm talking to a friend more so than talking to a salesman.\n\nI love everybody. I mean, you guys have been amazing, and I think that the warmth and automatically feeling like I'm a part of something. I'm a big it's a big family and, the genuine nature of just how you work, and that's what I look for. I look for, kind of that loyalty and that realistic view of things and how, like, the business will be, you know, and understanding it and explaining it to me. And It was just easy. It made it very easy.\n\nI I think I was sold on the group and the the, you know, the private group and just seeing more sold on just the idea of what you guys are doing and in a different aspect of something I've never really heard of.\n\nAnd trying something new. And that was a big part of it is, you know, and I think automatically being comfortable with the group and really explaining to me everything answering all of my questions.\n\nAnd I know I have a lot of questions, but answering all of my questions and and not being hesitant to to respond and and giving me all the nuts and bolts and not keeping me in the dark.\n\nYou've explored many different things, and I've explored many different avenues, of investing and and income and, you know, where where to put the money in with the best the best return for what we have I, you know, it's it's been the best that I have come across thus far.\n\nYour company or the business y'all running, you're running. It seems like for me, what hit home was how close I am. But I don't feel like me being able to talk to the CEO or the COO or the CFO still being at arms reach. That's like, I feel like I got in at the right time because I do believe that y'all gonna take off.\n\nAnd sooner than later, I might not be able to get to y'all. The way I want to or you might just be that big. You're gonna get you're gonna get that big. That's gonna be hard to reach.\n\nBut I feel like right now y'all are so tight It just it just works for me to be able to go on my phone and be able to text or to call and get a response within minutes. Hands down. That's it. Yeah.\n\nI I feel very secure that, your support and, the concept and also your programs, man. It's really great. Great. Because, basically, you don't have to do anything. Just, need to understand how you gotta move the money between the, the investment account, the process helping us, helping me go along and be patient.\n\nYeah. Which is very appreciated.\n\nI was reassuring that, you know, this was something that was gonna work because, you know, with most of these passive income opportunities, it's six months to a year before you see any profit, and this was one week, right, literally one week.\n\nI think I signed up on a Friday and the following Friday. I got my first profit.\n\nSo if that was pretty cool is having a coach and a little, really, a wealth management leader, like yourself, I'm kind of guy half leading the path and saying, hey, this is what I've done.\n\nThis is where I and and and you're right there, you know, when when I ask a question and and I say, hey, you know, what are your thoughts about? The staking. And what do you think about this? And and you're right there going, well, you know, don't don't do this. I wouldn't suggest it for, hey, do this instead.\n\nThose kind of things have really, you know, opened the doors to, you know, a further passive income and a lot less stress. And I think just opening the eyes and being just prized with the the return. Right? At first, it's too good to be true. Like, no way, you know, it's a it's a a face turner. It really is. And and just can't wait for more can't wait till more products come out and, and, you know, invest more and, just continue earning that that passive income and and creating that generation alone.\n\nWe'll use the best, especially in my case, you know, when I'm just starting, you know, I'm having some some some trouble and some difficulties of setting up my accounts.\n\nBut for the user, is there, like, every every hour I had to text him and he respond he respond right away. Who is the best? Yeah. He he helps a lot, but the program really works and the the support is good.\n\nFor me, it was, seeing some of the examples of the results. I know you showed me kind of some of your own personal results that you've seen from there. So that was huge. But, no, overall, it's been you guys have delivered on what you've, what you've said?\n\nI would say that the thing that makes you guys different is that you guys are reachable. I wanna say tangible, but if, like, there's a concern or if I'm apprehensive or maybe there's some slight anxiety about something. I can always just ask the question because, you know, clothes mouth don't get fed. So Yep.\n\nAsks, hey, what's going on with this? And what are we doing here? And and there's always like, hey, this is what's happening. Hey, we're doing this now.\n\nAnd that accretes, a sense of confidence and reassurance that. Okay. I did you the right people.\n\nUnderstanding that you have gone through the highs and lows made me comfortable in wanting to do business with you.\n\nA hundred percent.\n\nIt's definitely customer service. You know, I mean, being able to speak to you personally like we are right now and Julio just having him text away is different than any service. So even any financial service really. So that that's definitely made the difference.\n\nTransparency, there when when it comes to this, it's not the glitz, the glam, it's not the, hey, you do this. You'll be, you know, shopping on Rodeo Drive in twelve months. It's it's kinda like what's your ad dar, winning the lottery. This is to get to be true. You can sit here put whatever amount of money in and actually have the type of passive income that most people never get to have.\n\nThe response time, the communication, the honest tea and the verbiage and no beating around the bush. Ask a question you get asked.\n\nIndependent verification of your information.\n\nThat's terribly important because I don't know what's true on the internet. Anybody can put up testimonials, anybody can put up numbers on a screen. They're just screenshots. Who who knows where it came Right?\n\nBut independent verification through it was really comforting for me.\n\nThe communication on earth, I believe, was the first and, with you, you're always on point. Then, your other clients that you had on in your commercials to see their results, their truths of what they have done and see a result of now. Kind of pushes me. It pushed me, I should say then, to know, well, this this is something here real for the times that we are now that that can work And we can we can we can I can see results will come from this?\n\nI would say it's it's as passive as it as it gets. I'm aside from logging in each day. There's really no effort. The the main effort is really just the initial setup, which takes like ten minutes, and aside from just waiting for transactions to settle. You're just kind of rolling in each day. But aside from that, I don't know that I've come across anything this passive"}],"embed_options":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"174bd2","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true},"embedOptions":{"volumeControl":"true","fullscreenButton":"true","controlsVisibleOnLoad":"true","playerColor":"174bd2","bpbTime":"false","plugin":{"captions-v1":{"on":"true"}},"vulcan":true}},"options":{}};
